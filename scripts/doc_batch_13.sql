VALUES ('Anti-CASPR2 meningoencephalitis with thickened dura mater induced by various infections: A case report and literature review', 'With the update of novel autoantibodies and the expansion of the clinical spectrum, our understanding of autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is rapidly evolving. Anti-CASPR2 meningoencephalitis is a relatively rare condition that may be induced by infections. A young man presented with 3 episodes of meningoencephalitis potentially triggered by possible viral,  Across all 3 episodes, similar clinical manifestations and imaging features were observed. Although autoantibodies in the previous 2 phases were negative, the possibility of infection-related anti-CASPR2 meningoencephalitis remains highly suspected. The treatment regimen comprised antimicrobial agents, corticosteroid therapy, intravenous immunoglobulin, and rituximab administration. Following treatment, the patient’s condition improved with no recurrence to date. Repeat testing showed undetectable anti-CASPR2 immunoglobulin G in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Post-treatment contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the resolution of dural thickening. We further reviewed the mechanism of various infection-related AE and characteristics of CASPR2-related disease. To our knowledge, this is the first report of CASPR2 meningoencephalitis with thickened dura mater, indicating the importance of paying attention to antibody-negative AE and monitor antibodies repeatedly when necessary. In addition to immunotherapy, we recommend comprehensive management throughout the disease process. In recent years, antibody-positive autoimmune encephalitis (AE) has gradually gained public attention. With the update of novel autoantibodies and the expansion of the clinical spectrum, our understanding of AE is rapidly evolving. AE may be related to a variety of infections, including bacteria and viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Anti-CASPR2 meningoencephalitis is a relatively rare condition that can be similarly induced by infections. Different treatment strategies have been applied for CASPR2 encephalitis including steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), plasma exchange, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and/or rituximab. Herein, we detail a case of anti-CASPR2 meningoencephalitis with thickening of the cerebral dura mater, induced by several infections that have not previously been reported. In mid-October 2020, an 18-year-old male presented with bilateral lower extremity muscle soreness following military training. Four days later, he developed psychiatric symptoms, including irrelevant answers, gibberish speech, irritability, and sleep disturbances. He denied any relevant medical, medication, epidemiological, or prodromal infection history, and further denied a history of tobacco and alcohol consumption. On admission, his body temperature was 37.5 °C, and his blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate were normal. Neurological examination revealed a weakened tendon reflex in the right upper extremity and a probable positive Kernig sign. No other abnormalities were observed. Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) nucleic acid test results were negative. Routine blood tests, liver and renal function, electrolytes, procalcitonin level, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and coagulation function were all within the normal ranges. Serum immunity indices revealed an increase in serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) at 32.2 g/L, whereas the remaining indices were normal, including immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin M (IgM), complement C3, complement C4, IgG4, antinuclear antibody spectrum, cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, myeloperoxidase, neutrophil proteinase 3, and rheumatoid factor. Tumour marker tests, including alpha-fetoprotein, carcinoma embryonic antigen, carcinoma antigen 125, carcinoma antigen 199, cytokeratin fragment 21-1, neuron-specific enolase, and prostate-specific antigen were within the normal ranges. Myocardial enzyme tests revealed an increased lactate dehydrogenase level of 5302 U/L, increased aspartate aminotransferase level of 843 U/L, increased creatine kinase level of 39,875 U/L, and increased myoglobin level of 684.6 ng/mL. A thyroid autoantibody test revealed an increase in thyroid globulin antibody of 98.92 IU/mL. The lymphocyte subset test revealed an increase in CD3‐/CD19+ (B cells) at 21.42% concurrent with a decrease in CD3‐/CD16+ 56 + Abs (js3/16 + 56) at 125.38 cells/μL. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure was normal. Routine and biochemistry CSF tests were within normal ranges. Tests for the Japanese encephalitis antibody, Cryptococcus neoformans capsular antigen, and microbial DNA sequencing in CSF all also showed no abnormalities. Oligoclonal bands, AE antibodies (NMDAR, AMPAR1, AMPAR2, LGI1, CASPR2, and CABABR), and demyelinating antibodies (AQP4, MBP, MOG, and GFAP) in the serum and CSF were all negative. The results of electrocardiogram, chest CT, abdominal ultrasound, urinary ultrasound, and echocardiography results were normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral thickening of the dura mater, particularly on the left side (Fig.  (A–D) In phase I, enhanced brain MRI revealed thickening of the bilateral dura mater, particularly on the left side. (E–H) In phase I, enhanced brain MRI revealed a slight improvement in the lesion of the dura mater during the process of immunotherapy. (I–L) In phase II, enhanced brain MRI revealed that thickening of dura mater was relieved after approximately 1 month of comprehensive treatment. The results of evaluation were as follows: the patient presented with limbic encephalitis characterized by psychiatric symptoms, sleep disturbances, and a low fever, indicating an inflammatory response. Suspicious positive signs of meningeal irritation and thickening of the dura mater suggested meningeal involvement. Accordingly, the patient was diagnosed with autoimmune meningoencephalitis, potentially induced by a viral infection. Following admission, the patient was treated with acyclovir, olanzapine, phenobarbital, and venous fluid replacement. After the diagnosis was clarified, impulsion therapy of IVIG (0.4 g/kg/d*5d) and methylprednisolone (1g/d*3d, 500 mg/d*2d, 250 mg/d*1d) were administered. Reexamination of the brain MRI in early November 2020 revealed a slight improvement in the lesion of the dura mater during immunotherapy (Fig.  Following discharge, the patient experienced a marked increase in fatigue, loss of emotions, and crying, accompanied by a low fever. The patient was subsequently readmitted to our hospital. The results of the COVID-19 nucleic acid test were still negative. Routine blood tests revealed an increase in white blood cell and neutrophil counts. Widal and Weil Felix tests revealed a positive Salmonella typhi O antibody titer of 1:160 and a positive Salmonella paratyphoid C antibody titer of 1:320. The serum galactomannan test revealed an increase in Aspergillus antigen at 0.61 (0.00–0.49) and the serum (1,3)-β-D-glucan test revealed an increase in fungal (1–3)-β-D-glucan at 210.4 pg/mL (<60 pg/mL). Quantitative determination of endotoxin levels and blood cultures revealed no significant abnormalities. The CSF pressure was normal. The CSF routine and biochemistry test, oligoclonal bands test, serum IgG4, serum and CSF AE antibodies (DPPX, IgLON5, GABAARα1, GABAARβ3, GlyRα1, mGluR5, D2R, Neurexin3α, GAD65), serum and CSF paraneoplastic syndrome antibodies (Hu, Yo, Ri, CV2, Ma2, Amphiphysin, Mal, SOX1, Tr/DNER, Zic4, GAD65, PKCγ, Recoverin, Titin), and CSF microbial RNA sequencing were all normal. Ultrasonography of the bilateral inguinal, neck, and axillary regions revealed bilateral cervical lymph node enlargement, indicating possible reactive hyperplasia, with no significant abnormal enlargement of the lymph nodes in the bilateral axilla and groin areas. Following lumbar puncture, the patient received IVIG (0.4 g/kg*5d) and methylprednisolone (60 mg/d). Considering the possibility of paratyphoid fever and fungal infection, levofloxacin and fluconazole were administered, while methylprednisolone was reduced to 30 mg/day for continued immune regulation treatment. In early December 2020, enhanced brain MRI revealed no bilateral thickening of the dura mater (Fig.  The patient again presented with a fever in late December 2022, with a maximum body temperature of 38 °C, and COVID-19 nucleic acid detection was positive. The patient ultimately developed sleep disorders 2 days later and psychiatric symptoms 6 days later. Physical examination revealed horizontal nystagmus to the left in both eyes with no other abnormalities. C-reactive protein and free thyroxine levels were slightly elevated. Serum cytokines tests further revealed an increase of interleukin (IL)-17 at 39.1 pg/mL (≤19 pg/mL). Routine and biochemical blood tests, Widal test, Weil–Felix test, and immunity indices (immunoglobulin A, IgG, IgM, complement C3, complement C4, IgG4, cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, antinuclear antibody spectrum, myeloperoxidase, neutrophil proteinase 3, and anti-glomerular basement antibody) showed no other abnormal findings. CSF pressure, routine CSF tests, biochemical tests, CSF cryptococcal capsular antigen levels, and oligoclonal bands were all normal. On December 27, 2022 testing for serum and CSF AE antibodies (NMDAR, AMPAR1, AMPAR2, LGI1, CASPR2, CABABR, DPPX, IgLON5, GABAARα1, GABAARβ3, GlyRα1, mGluR5, D2R, Neurexin3α, GAD65) and ganglioside antibodies (GM1, GM2, GM3, GM4, GD1a, GD1b, GD2, GD3, GT1a, GT1b, GQ1b, sulfatide) were planned. All tests for CSF antibodies were negative. Serum anti-GT1a antibody IgG and serum anti-CASPR2 antibody IgG were positive at a titer of 1:10 (Fig.  (A) The patient CSF immunofluorescence staining (TBA) at 4× magnification. (B) The patient CSF immunofluorescence staining (TBA) at 20× magnification showed vascular-like abnormal signal. (C) The patient CSF Caspr2 staining (CBA) was negative. (D) The patient serum Caspr2 staining (CBA) was positive at a dilution of 1:10. (A–D) In phase III, PET-CT of the brain revealed that the dura mater of the left frontal part was slightly thicker, metabolism was normal, and there were no obvious abnormalities in the brain parenchyma. (E–H) In phase III, the left dura mater was strengthened and thicker than the contralateral region in the enhanced brain MRI. (I–L) In phase III, the enhanced brain MRI showed that thickening of the dura mater was relieved after over 1 month of comprehensive treatment. PET-CT = positron emission tomography-computed tomography. The case summary was as follows: the patient had no manifestations of cranial nerve involvement or sensory disturbances, indicating that the anti-GT1a antibody was not responsible for the symptoms. Based on the above clinical manifestations, the positive serum CASPR2 antibodies, and thickening of the dura mater, the patient was diagnosed with CASPR2-related autoimmune encephalomeningitis. During his hospitalization, methylprednisolone (500 mg/d*3d) and IVIG (0.4 g/kg*5d) were administrated. Ganciclovir, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone were further administered for anti-infection therapy. In early January 2023, rituximab (640 mg) was intravenously administered. The patient’s symptoms substantially improved. Reexamination of serum and CSF anti-CASPR2 antibody IgG levels were negative. Following discharge, the patient continued to receive oral methylprednisolone (40 mg/day) as maintenance therapy. Repeat brain MRI scan in February (Fig.  In June 2023, the young man again presented with obsessive-compulsive symptoms, such as repacking clothes for a short time after a long journey. During hospitalization in July 2023, routine CSF, biochemical, cytokine, oligoclonal bands, anti-CASPR2 antibody, both in the serum and CSF, were reexamined, and brain MRI was performed. No apparent abnormalities were observed. The patient was treated with intravenous rituximab (600 mg) therapy in July 2023 (Fig.  The clinical course of our case. As mentioned above, in phase I, the patient manifested with low fever, limbic encephalitis, probable meningeal irritation signs, and thickened dura mater. Antiviral therapies and immunotherapies were effective at this stage. Although the results of pathogenic assays and autoimmunity-related antibodies were negative, viral infection-induced autoimmune meningoencephalitis was diagnosed. However, the patient presented with a low fever and limbic encephalitis in phase II. Laboratory tests indicated paratyphoid fever and fungal infection, whereas autoimmunity-related antibodies in both serum and CSF were negative. The patient was diagnosed with Salmonella infection-induced AE. Following anti-infective therapy and immunotherapy, his symptoms improved, the titers of the Widal and Weil Felix tests decreased, and no thickening of the dura mater was observed. In phase III, the patient was readmitted with fever, SARS-CoV-2 infection, limbic encephalitis, and thickening of the left dura mater. The serum anti-CASPR2 antibody IgG test results were positive. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with CASPR2-related autoimmune meningoencephalitis. Reviewing the 3 phases, similar clinical manifestations and imaging characteristics were observed. Although autoantibodies in the previous 2 phases were negative, the possibility of infection-related anti-CASPR2 meningoencephalitis remains highly suspected. These 3 episodes of encephalitis were mediated by possible viral, Salmonella, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. This case indicates the importance of paying attention to antibody-negative AE and monitoring antibodies repeatedly when necessary, as the results of antibodies may be negative in the early stages. The findings of previous studies have shown that the pathogenesis of AE may include disease triggers (infections), predisposing factors (human leukocyte antigen), and an interplay between these 2 factors. To date, no cases of AE induced by Salmonella or other enterobacteria have been reported. Noninfectious neurological complications of typhoid fever include encephalopathy, neuropsychiatric disorders, cerebral edema, cerebellar ataxia, Parkinsonism, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and brainstem encephalitis. Immune-mediated processes and endotoxaemia have been proposed as possible underlying mechanisms. It has been clearly shown that SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the respiratory system, causing mild to severe respiratory diseases. However, this virus also affects the nervous system, and can potentially exhibit neurotropic and neuroinvasive properties. CASPR2 is a cell adhesion molecule belonging to the neurexin IV superfamily. CASPR2 is encoded by the contactin-associated protein-like 2 gene on chromosome 7q35. CASPR2 is located in the limbic system, basal ganglia, neurones of other motor areas, and sensory pathways, and is particularly abundant in the temporal lobe. The most common MRI findings have been found to be T2 hyperintensities in the medial temporal lobe, followed by hippocampal atrophy, middle temporal gyrus sclerosis, and hippocampal sclerosis. The most common FDG-PET finding is hypometabolism in the temporal lobe. Based on the consensus regarding the diagnosis and treatment of AE, This is the first report of CASPR2 meningoencephalitis with thickened dura mater which was mediated by possible viral, Salmonella, and SARS-CoV-2 infection, reminding clinicians that the possibility of CASPR2 meningoencephalitis should also be considered when imaging only reveals thickening of the dura mater, also indicating the importance of paying attention to antibody-negative AE and monitoring antibodies repeatedly when necessary when the results of antibodies may be negative in the early stages. In addition to immunotherapy, one of the crucial measures for managing CASPR2-related AE or meningoencephalitis is the prevention of infections caused by viral, bacterial, and other rare pathogens. During immunosuppressive therapy to prevent disease recurrence and progression, some patients may develop opportunistic infections that can worsen their condition. We recommend comprehensive management throughout the disease process, dynamic monitoring of immune indicators such as IgG, IgM, and B lymphocytes, and advising patients to maintain a regular schedule and appropriate exercise, all of which may improve the disease.', 'PubMed_Central', 'sleep_disorders', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/', 'research_article', '{"content_hash": "35a9151b0792dc10", "embedding_date": "2025-06-25T14:21:26.718849", "scraper_source": "PubMed_Central", "category": "research_literature", "subcategory": "pubmed_central", "document_type": "research_article", "published_date": "", "original_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/"}', 16455);

VALUES ('Using Rasch analysis to assess the latent construct of the Capacity to Work Index in a Swedish working population sample', 'Measurements of capacity to work (CTW) in relation to common mental disorders (CMD) are needed to improve research on determinants for maintained work participation (WP). The aim of this study was to assess the construct validity of the Capacity to Work Index (C2WI) in a heterogenous sample of the Swedish working population. Cross-sectional web survey data among Swedish employees ( Common mental disorders (CMD) impact public health and work participation (WP) [ The generic Work Ability House model has four dimensions suggested to interact: health and functional capacities; competence; values, attitudes, motivation; and work, work community and management [ As a complementary CMD-specific approach, the Capacity to Work Index (C2WI) was developed to suit a working population and to contribute with details on how CTW varies. The C2WI was recently assessed in a field study [ The ‘Work Participation and Mental Health at Work’ project is part of the network ‘New Ways’—‘mental health at work’ aiming for scientific knowledge to promote WP and prevent sickness absence. This cross-sectional study utilized data from a web-based survey of employed individuals aged 18 years and older. There are no public registers of currently working employees in Sweden, so different recruitment procedures were used to obtain a large sample from heterogeneous work contexts. Initially, private sector employers and Swedish trade unions were contacted and provided with detailed information about the study. The recruitment of public sector employees was then conducted similarly. Employers who agreed to participate provided employees’ work emails. Study details, ethical considerations, and survey links were sent directly to the employees. Union members received the information from their union through newsletters via email. The initial data collection recruiting employees in the private sector yielded a limited number of participants ( Data were collected during 24 November 2021 and 18 August 2022. The first data collection was conducted by the SOM Institute, a non-profit academic web-survey centre within the University of Gothenburg. The second data collection, utilizing the web panel, was conducted by an external survey company (Enkätfabriken, Gothenburg, Sweden). The survey included questions on sociodemographic information, employment sector, work characteristics, and health-related instruments. Survey links remained open for 4 weeks. Two reminders were sent to employees recruited through employers, whereas no reminders were sent to employees recruited through unions. The present study included participants with complete responses on gender (those identifying as non-binary were excluded due to small numbers,  The C2WI consists of 17 statements ( The Swedish version of the World Health Organization—Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) was utilized. The WHO-5 is a unidimensional index measuring overall subjective well-being over a 2-week period on a six-point Likert scale ranging from ‘All of the time’ (coded 5) to ‘Never’ (coded 0). As suggested by Bech (2012) [ Age was coded into three categories: 18–34, 35–54, and 55–74 years. Level of education was coded into three categories: university/higher education, upper secondary, and compulsory school. Work sector was measured with three categories: public sector, private sector, and ‘others’. The category ‘others’ was deemed too small ( Data were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics Version: 29.0.0.0. Descriptive statistics are presented as frequencies and percentages. In the absence of established cut-off scores, the descriptive statistics for WHO-5 ( Sociodemographic characteristics of the study population The study population is not a simple random sample that might compromise representativity and generalizability. Dispersed numbers of participants are due to internal missing. Median = 46 years was used in the Rasch analysis (Q1 = 35, Q3 = 55). Descriptive statistics of the Capacity to Work Index (C2WI) in relation to CMD, based on the Swedish ‘Work participation and mental health at work’ (ADAPT) research project: 2021–2022, ( The Rasch analysis was performed using RUMM2030 software [ The overall fit to the RM was assessed by a χ We fitted the RM to two versions of the C2WI; the 17-item version as developed by Hensing et al. (2024) [ To determine if individuals with mental health problems were more prone to grasp the essence of the C2WI, a subgroup analysis was conducted. The subgroup consisted of participants who scored at or below the first quartile of the WHO-5 index (≤44), and by selecting the option ‘mental health problem’ when responding to the question: ‘Do you have a chronic illness, problem or disability’ ( The project received ethical approval by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Gothenburg (no. 783-106) and by The Swedish Ethical Review Authority (no. 2020-06031). The introductory letter informed employees that the study was independent of the employer, voluntary, and that they could withdraw at any time. It also provided details of their legal rights under the General Data Protection Regulation. As can be seen in  Overall model fit statistics for all random datasets and the total sample are presented in  Overall model fit of the C2WI, all samples, Andersen’s conditional likelihood (CLR) test, degrees of freedom (DF) Individual item fit was assessed using multiple sample sizes as indicators, and items showing misfit are summarized in  Items showing misfit according to various items fit statistics Bold indicates statistically significant misfit. The initial assessment of the 17-item scale indicated that the items did not discriminate as required, and the overall fit to the RM was poor. As a next step, the Rasch analysis was performed on the seven-item scale. The results for the overall model fit and the item fit indicators are summarized in  A subgroup analysis was done by testing the seven-item scale among participants reporting low mental well-being in random samples of varying sizes ( The objective of this study was to determine the construct validity of the C2WI using the RM. In particular, the study sought to ascertain the unidimensionality of the instrument, the appropriateness of the response categories, and the presence of DIF with regard to gender and age. The 17-item scale did not reach predetermined levels of fit in any of the analyses. The seven-item scale indicated unidimensionality; yet, the overall fit to the RM remained deficient, and multiple indicators on the item level showed a lack of fit. The result for the subgroup reporting low mental well-being showed a better fit to the RM, with fewer items exhibiting disordered thresholds and better targeting compared to the corresponding analysis in previous tests. However, this was not sufficient to distinguish between response categories. The result indicates multidimensionality, which is consistent with the theoretical understanding of CTW as a phenomenon that occurs in a dynamic interaction between the individual and the work context. CTW is a multifaceted construct that encompasses a range of elements, including knowledge, skills, abilities and motivation. These elements are shaped by the specific social settings in which they are practised. CTW is best understood as a continuum, from excellent to very poor; thus, the latent construct is not absolute; rather, it is relative to the context in which human performance occurs. The C2WI was developed to advance the understanding of how CTW is reduced. The WAI contains open-ended questions such as ‘current work ability compared with the lifetime best’ and ‘work ability in relation to the demands of the job’. Such questions reflect ‘that’ the work ability is reduced, and to what extent, but they do not really provide information about ‘how’. The C2WI was developed in a multiple step process [ In future studies comparing C2WI with other instruments measuring relevant aspects for WP, such as competence and work-related self-efficacy, could give complementary information to the construct validity, such as content validity and possible correlations between the different constructs. While the C2WI did not meet the Rasch criteria for construct validity, it may nonetheless reflect a satisfactory content validity and prove useful in predicting WP. The study population represents different sectors, occupations, gender, age groups and varies in several other ways. We consider this, as well as the large sample size, a strength, as multiple experiences and work contexts contribute to the analysis. The sample size may have been unnecessary large, but since data were not collected for the Rasch analysis only, we decided to use the full sample. Danielsson et al. (2020) [ In our study, we used multiple techniques to overcome the risk with χ Both the full version and a short version of the instrument were validated. It has been suggested in the literature that determining which items to include in an instrument should be guided by considerations other than just psychometric properties [ Available softwares for doing Rasch analyses have pros and cons. We used the RUMM2030 in which, as mentioned earlier, the global test of model fit is sensitive to larger sample sizes. Measures described in the previous paragraph contributed to overcome some of these problems. CTW in relation to CMD assessed by the C2WI did not meet the criteria for construct validity as outlined by the RM. The findings can serve to reinforce the understanding of the CTW-construct as multidimensional. Real-world experiences of CTW are multifaceted and reflect expressions of mental health in a variety of work settings. The results were discouraging but the attempt is justified given the lack of instruments determining CTW as a factor that may maintain WP in relation to CMD in a working population. When C2WI was assessed in a subgroup comprising participants with low mental well-being, the instrument demonstrated a stronger tendency towards attaining the predetermined level of fit to the RM.', 'PubMed_Central', 'preventive_medicine', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/', 'research_article', '{"content_hash": "2d16423ada9addd5", "embedding_date": "2025-06-25T14:21:28.330414", "scraper_source": "PubMed_Central", "category": "research_literature", "subcategory": "pubmed_central", "document_type": "research_article", "published_date": "", "original_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/"}', 10061);

VALUES ('Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate Decline is Causally Associated with Acute Pulmonary Embolism: A Nested Case–Control and Mendelian Randomization Study', 'Renal dysfunction is highly prevalent among patients with pulmonary embolism (PE). This study combined population-based study and Mendelian randomization (MR) to observe the relationship between renal function and PE. A nested case–control study were performed using data of PE patients and controls were from two nationwide cohorts, the China pUlmonary thromboembolism REgistry Study (CURES) and China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey (CHARLS). Baseline characteristics were balanced using propensity score matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting. Restricted cubic spline models were applied for the relationship between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline and the risk of PE. Bidirectional two-sample MR analyses were performed using genome-wide association study summary statistics for eGFR involving 1,201,909 individuals and for PE from the FinnGen consortium. 
The nested case–control study including 17,547 participants (6,322 PE patients) found that eGFR distribution was significantly different between PE patients and controls (
 Our findings support the hypothesis that renal function decline contributes to an elevated PE risk. Together with the high prevalence of chronic kidney diseases globally, there arises the necessity for monitoring and modulation of renal function in effective PE prevention. 
Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) refers to a condition in which the pulmonary artery or its branches are obstructed by a thrombus that originated from the deep veins of the pelvis and legs. Together with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), they are commonly known as venous thromboembolism (VTE). With an annual incidence of 39 to 115/100,000 population, PE is the third most prevalent cardiovascular disease worldwide, after ischemic heart disease and stroke and is one of the leading causes of cardiovascular death.

To balance baseline characteristics of the PE and control populations, propensity score-matching (PSM) was employed, followed by inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). The individual propensity to the presence of PE was estimated using a logistic regression model incorporating confounding variables as covariates, including variables that were significantly different between groups in univariable analyses and were known to be associated with renal function. Then, 1:1 PSM was performed between two groups, followed by IPTW performed as previously described.

Note: The table illustrated the odd ratios and 95% CI calculated by inverse variance weighted, maximum likelihood, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO methods, using primary and supplementary instrumental variables, when PE was the exposure and eGFR decline was the outcome. In this study, we provided the evidence that renal function decline was probably causally associated with PE. The nested case–control study based on two large-scale cohorts suggested that low eGFR was associated with PE prevalence, followed by MR analyses using the largest eGFR GWAS to date, confirmed that genetically predicted eGFR decline was associated with the development of PE. This is the first study combining large-scale observational analyses and MR that reveals the association between declined renal function and the occurrence of PE. 
Previously, studies have demonstrated high incidence of VTE in CKD or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) populations confirmed by MR analysis.
 
The mechanism under the relationship between renal insufficiency and PE contain several pathways: nephrotic syndrome is the most recognized condition of high risk of VTE, with clear mechanisms of the urinary loss of antithrombin and higher level of platelet activation. Moreover, studies showed endogenous anticoagulants such as antithrombin were lower than general population in patients with nephrotic syndrome. However, inconsistent results were reported by another study using renal impaired population caused by various reasons, suggesting that loss of antithrombin might only exist in patients with damaged glomerular filtration barriers.
 
We innovatively quantify the decrease of eGFR that lower than 88 mL/min per 1.73 m
 
The primary strength of the current study is combining the nested case–control study and MR study with large population, which minimized bias from confounding and reverse causality. Moreover, unlike previous studies focusing on VTE, the research for the first time uncovered the potential causal relationship between renal function and PE. Furthermore, the MR analyses employed genetic instruments of eGFR from the most recent and largest GWAS studies, and findings were reinforced by the consistent results observed using two independent sets of IVs and several analytical approaches for MR estimates. However, several limitations of the current study are necessary to be discussed. First, a major limitation of the MR design is horizontal pleiotropy. However, in this study, biases induced by pleiotropic effects are likely minimal. There was no indications of horizontal pleiotropy in the MR-Egger test and consistent results were drawn from several sensitivity analyses. Second, the results of the nested case–control study could be potentially biased since cases and controls came from two cohorts employing different technical specifications. Nevertheless, both cohorts employed the same and standardized test for serum creatinine (
 
This study provided compelling evidence from a large population supporting eGFR decline is an independent risk factor for PE, and the risk of PE significantly increased when kidney function declines to the threshold right below the normal level (88 mL/min per 1.73 m', 'PubMed_Central', 'preventive_medicine', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/', 'research_article', '{"content_hash": "a429b5a8c288881f", "embedding_date": "2025-06-25T14:21:29.213051", "scraper_source": "PubMed_Central", "category": "research_literature", "subcategory": "pubmed_central", "document_type": "research_article", "published_date": "", "original_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/"}', 11454);

VALUES ('Male and female pattern hair loss', 'Androgenetic alopecia, commonly referred to as male or female pattern hair loss, is a prevalent condition encountered in clinical practice. It is important to identify potential underlying causes and differentiate it from other forms of hair loss, which may require referral to a dermatologist for management. Pharmacological treatments for female pattern hair loss include minoxidil (topical and oral) and antiandrogens such as spironolactone. For male pattern hair loss, minoxidil and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (e.g. finasteride, dutasteride) can be used. Combination therapy is commonly employed, with clinical improvement typically requiring a minimum of 6 months. Supplements and other treatments have varying levels of evidence, and counselling is important to help patients make informed decisions about their management. Hair is deeply intertwined with a person’s identity. Hair loss therefore can have a profound psychological impact and induce feelings of low self-worth, lack of physical attractiveness and fear of social rejection. In brief, the hair cycle consists of 3 main phases: anagen (growth), catagen (transitional) and telogen (resting), with hair follicles cycling between these stages to produce and shed hair over time. In AGA, alterations in the hair cycle include shortening of anagen and lengthening of telogen, resulting in reduced hair growth. There are 2 forms of alopecia: scarring (where the follicles are permanently lost) and non-scarring. AGA is a non-scarring alopecia. As the follicular unit is preserved, AGA is considered at least partially reversible. The prevalence of AGA increases with age. Male pattern hair loss is thought to affect 80% of males by the age of 80. Both males and females with AGA report hair thinning. Female patients may report progressive hair shedding and loss of ponytail volume, and male patients may report hairline recession. A positive family history or a history of thyroid dysfunction may be present. There may also be an association with polycystic ovary syndrome. The causes of hair loss are diverse and varied, although the distribution of hair loss observed can provide clues about potential triggers. Severe psychological stress, systemic illness, endocrinological abnormalities, nutritional deficiencies, infections and malignancy can all contribute to hair loss, and a detailed history and thorough clinical examination can help differentiate potential causes. On examination, in female pattern hair loss, there is diffuse hair thinning with the temporal and occipital scalp usually preserved. Widening of the central part with frontal accentuation (i.e. Christmas tree pattern) may be noted. In male pattern hair loss, there is usually bitemporal hairline recession with or without scalp vertex hair loss. Commonly used classification scales include the Norwood–Hamilton scale for male pattern hair loss, and the Ludwig scale and Sinclair scale for female pattern hair loss. The hair pull test and dermoscopy of the scalp (also known as trichoscopy) can assist in the clinical diagnosis of AGA. The hair pull test involves holding approximately 60 hairs between the index finger and thumb and pulling these hairs away from the vertex, parietal and occipital areas of the scalp. A positive hair pull test is defined when more than 2 hairs are removed from the scalp. Trichoscopy of AGA demonstrates miniaturised hairs, with a reduction of hairs per follicular unit; the follicular openings (ostia) are preserved. Scalp biopsies are not routinely performed; however, they may be used if there is diagnostic uncertainty. There are multiple differentials for AGA. For example, telogen effluvium presents as abrupt hair loss following pregnancy or a severe psychological or physical stressor. The hair pull test is positive and empty follicles may be seen on trichoscopy. Alopecia areata presents as well-circumscribed patches of hair loss in adults or children; trichoscopy may reveal black dots and exclamation mark hairs. AGA can present simultaneously with other forms of hair loss, such as telogen effluvium. Referral to resources such as DermNet for photographs can aid in the diagnosis. Symptoms such as scalp pain, itch or burning, extensive hair loss, or rapid hair loss in the absence of a preceding trigger, warrant urgent escalation of care to a dermatologist. It is important that the primary care physician is able to identify scarring alopecias to allow early referral to a dermatologist for treatment, as these can lead to permanent hair loss. If hormonal abnormalities are suspected that cannot be managed in the primary care setting, general practitioners (GPs) may consider the involvement of an endocrinologist to optimise patient management. As hair loss affects a person’s physical appearance, it is important that patients are counselled appropriately about treatment expectations, including the risks and benefits of treatments, so that they can make informed decisions about their management. In most cases, treatments are not curative and are designed to slow progression of hair loss and stimulate hair growth. Concurrent conditions such as tinea capitis or seborrhoeic dermatitis must be addressed, and nutritional deficiencies such as iron deficiency, or metabolic disorders such as thyroid dysfunction, must be treated prior to starting treatment for hair loss. Most pharmacological treatments take at least 6 months to show a response and may need to be continued long term. Referral to dermatologists may then be considered if there is no response to treatment after 6 months. Serial photography can assist with monitoring response to treatment. Nonpharmacological management should be encouraged, and this includes the use of healthy hair care practices, creative hair styling and the use of cosmetic camouflage (e.g. natural keratin fibres). Pharmacological treatments may stimulate hair growth and/or prevent further hair loss ( NB1: Dutasteride is approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (Australia) for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Combination therapy (e.g. with antiandrogens) is more effective than monotherapy at minimising hair loss and may be considered for those with moderate to severe AGA. In female pattern hair loss, antiandrogen therapy may be considered particularly in those with signs of hyperandrogenism (e.g. hirsutism, acne). For  topical minoxidil (2 to 5%) with oral spironolactone 25 to 50 mg oral minoxidil (compounded into 0.25 mg tablets) with oral spironolactone 25 to 50 mg sublingual or oral minoxidil 0.25 to 1 mg with oral spironolactone 25 to 50 mg and oral finasteride 1 mg in postmenopausal women. Co-prescription of contraception with spironolactone is strongly encouraged (see  5-alpha-reductase inhibitors can be used off label in postmenopausal women; however, evidence for its use is limited. This treatment is generally not recommended in premenopausal women due to the risk of feminisation of the male fetus. For  topical minoxidil 5% with oral finasteride 0.5 to 1 mg sublingual or oral minoxidil (compounded into 2.5 to 5 mg tablets) with oral finasteride 1 mg. Topical finasteride (0.1 to 0.25% solution or lotion, used once or twice daily) is being investigated as a treatment for AGA. In a phase 3 randomised controlled trial, the efficacy of topical finasteride 0.25% spray was compared with oral finasteride 1 mg as well as placebo. Although there was a significant improvement in target area hair count with topical finasteride compared with placebo, no difference in hair diameter was noted. Generally, treatment is continued according to patient preference and tolerance of medications. Stopping treatment leads to progression of AGA. Nutritional supplements such as zinc, vitamins B and D, and antioxidants have been used extensively for hair loss; however, evidence for their efficacy is highly variable. It is essential that clinicians appropriately counsel patients as the benefits of nutritional interventions are unknown, their use may be expensive and lead to toxic effects at high doses, and they can interact with medications and test results, particularly biotin. There are several other treatment options that all have limited evidence. Mesotherapy involves the intradermal injection of therapeutic agents and bioactive substances. The use of platelet-rich plasma has been proposed for many dermatological disorders given its anti-inflammatory and regenerative properties through angiogenesis, cell differentiation and proliferation. Low-level laser therapy devices emit low-power coherent monochromatic red light that has been shown to promote hair growth as a result of increased blood flow to the hair follicle. Patients in whom medical therapy has failed may consider surgical management, which involves hair transplantation and results in permanent hair restoration. Treatment of AGA involves a multipronged approach, where medical treatments are personalised to the patient, considering goals, cost and comorbidities. Referral to a dermatologist should be considered if the diagnosis is unclear, scarring alopecia is suspected, patients do not respond after 6 months of active pharmacological treatment, there is psychological distress due to hair loss, or if there are concomitant symptoms such as pain or discomfort. Patients should be counselled from the outset about the array of treatment options for AGA, and patient expectations should be guided with regard to response to treatments.', 'PubMed_Central', 'primary_care_guidelines', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/', 'research_article', '{"content_hash": "af557a64514ea981", "embedding_date": "2025-06-25T14:21:30.043905", "scraper_source": "PubMed_Central", "category": "research_literature", "subcategory": "pubmed_central", "document_type": "research_article", "published_date": "", "original_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/"}', 9497);

VALUES ('Nanoparticle encapsulation enables systemic IGF-Trap delivery to inhibit intracerebral glioma growth', 'Glioblastoma is an aggressive brain cancer with a 5-year survival rate of 5–10%. Current therapeutic options are limited, due in part to drug exclusion by the blood–brain barrier, restricting access of targeted drugs to the tumor. The receptor for the type 1 insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1R) was identified as a therapeutic target in glioblastoma. We previously reported that the intracerebral growth of glioma cells with reduced IGF-1R levels was inhibited. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the sensitivity of glioma cells to a novel IGF-axis inhibitor, the IGF-Trap, and optimize its delivery to the brain. We tested the effect of the IGF-Trap on the growth of the human glioma stem cells MES-1123 and U87 MG cells, and of murine GL261 cells in vivo, using subcutaneous and orthotopic implantation. We show that the growth of glioma cells implanted subcutaneously or orthotopically in the brain was inhibited by systemic and direct intracerebral administration of IGF-Trap, respectively, resulting in increased survival. To increase the efficiency of systemic delivery to the brain, we encapsulated the IGF-Trap in trimethyl chitosan (TRIOZAN™) nanoparticles prior to intravenous injection. We found that nanoparticle encapsulation increased the uptake and retention of the IGF-Trap in the brain and resulted in an improved therapeutic effect against intra-cerebrally growing tumors. Our results identify the IGF-Trap as a potent inhibitor of intracerebral glioma growth and show that encapsulation in nanoparticles can improve delivery of biologics such as the IGF-Trap to the brain, thereby enhancing the therapeutic response. Glioma cells growing in the brain were sensitive to treatment with the IGF-Trap. Encapsulation in TRIOZAN nanoparticles increased brain levels of systemically administered IGF-Trap, inhibited glioma growth, and increased survival. The clinical management of glioma has been hampered by limited access of targeted biologics to the tumor site, due to exclusion by the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Effective treatment of glioma, therefore, faces the double challenge of identifying drugs that target specific drivers of glioma growth in vivo and successfully delivering those inhibitors to the tumor site to curtail its growth. In the present study, we aimed to address both of these challenges. Our results identify blockade of the IGF-axis as an effective therapeutic strategy to inhibit intracerebral glioma growth. They also show that encapsulation of this biologic in TRIOZAN, a trimethyl chitosan-based nanoparticle, increased the efficiency of its systemic delivery to the brain and enhanced its therapeutic effect in an orthotopic murine glioma model. These results have translational implications for the treatment of glioma but may also be more broadly relevant for the management of other brain tumors, including brain metastases from other primary malignancies. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most prevalent primary brain tumor in adults. Glioblastoma occurs at higher rates in persons older than 55 years of age and the 5-year survival rate for GBM patients is a dismal 5–10%. The ligands, insulin-like growth factors (IGF-1 and IGF-2) are involved in cell growth and differentiation. Ligand binding triggers IGF-1R signaling via the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways and nuclear IGF-1R transport to activate gene transcription, thereby regulating resistance to apoptosis, cell proliferation, and cell cycle progression and promoting tumor growth. We previously reported on the bioengineering of a potent IGF-1R signaling inhibitor, the IGF-Trap—a fusion protein consisting of the entire extracellular domain of the human IGF-1R fused to the Fc domain of human IgG One major challenge to successful treatment of GBM and other brain malignancies is effective drug delivery to the brain, as drug exclusion by the blood–brain barrier (BBB) limits drug access to the tumor. The BBB is a semi-permeable layer of specialized endothelial cells as well as astrocytic end-feet processes and basement membrane that protect the brain from foreign and potentially harmful substances. Human U87MG and mouse GL261 glioma cells were obtained from the ATCC and the DTP/DCTD/NCI Tumor Repository, respectively. The use of these cells as GBM models has been extensively reviewed elsewhere. All mouse experiments were carried out in strict accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC) “Guide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals” and under the conditions and procedures approved by the Animal Care Committee of McGill University (AUP number: 5733). All mice were bred in the animal facility of the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Center and used for the experiments at the ages of 7–12 weeks old. The experiments were performed in male (or as indicated) NSG mice (for U87 MG, MES-1123, and orthotopic GL261 injections) or in syngeneic C57Bl/6 mice (for subcutaneous GL261 injections). The IGF-Trap is a fusion protein consisting of the entire extracellular domain of the human IGF-1R fused to the Fc portion of human IgG Glioma cells were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in full medium. The medium was then replaced with FBS-free medium containing, or not, 10 ng/ml of IGF-1 and in the presence or absence of IGF-Trap, at the indicated molar ratios to IGF-1. The cells were incubated for up to 96 hours and the increase in cell numbers was analyzed every 24 h by quantifying formazan crystals reduced by the NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductase enzyme—an indicator of metabolic activity. Absorbance at 570nm was measured using the Infinite 200 PRO microplate reader (TECAN Switzerland, Morrisville, NC, USA). Cell cycle progression was analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells in 6-well plates (5 × 10 U87MG or GL261 cells (1 × 10 U87MG (2 × 10 TRIOZAN™ nanoparticles (commercialized by Ovensa Inc.) were formed as an ionic complex between the polysaccharides trimethylamine chitosan (TRIOZAN™, Mw > 50 kDa, degree of quaternization > 50%) - a cationic biopolymer and sodium dextran sulfate (DS) - an anionic biopolymer, mixed with the ionic gelation agent tripolyphosphate (TPP) at a fixed TRIOZAN:DS:TPP ratio. A microfluidic chip with controlled flow rates (Precision NanoSystems, Vancouver, BC, Canada) was used to improve reproducibility between preparations. In this complex, TRIOZAN™ is added in excess to the negatively charged polymers, to retain a positive overall surface charge. The zeta-potential of the nanoparticles was measured and was equal to +14.4 ±0.7 mV in PBS pH 7.4, consistent with a surface composition of trimethyl chitosan. Nanoparticle encapsulation of the IGF-Trap was achieved by precipitating the two polyelectrolytes to form complexes (PEC) in the presence of IGF-Trap. Excess, non-encapsulated IGF-Trap was removed by centrifugation (30 min at 42,000 To enable detection of the IGF-Trap in vivo, it was conjugated to a near-infrared fluorescent dye (CF680R-succinimide) using an average of 2 dye molecules/IGF-Trap (λex 680 nm/λem 701 nm), as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Biotium, Fremont CA, USA). The CF™680R succinimide ester (NHS-CF™680) was covalently bound to primary amines of IGF-Trap. The mixture of the IGF-Trap with the CF™ dye was agitated for 1h at room temperature, pH 8.0, and the fluorescently labeled IGF-Trap was purified from excess free CF™680R using an Amicon centrifugal filter Eppendorf tube with a 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff, and rinsed 4 times with fresh PBS. The labeled protein was detectable by confocal microscopy performed on frozen sections and by optical imaging in live animals using the IVIS Spectrum/200. NSG mice were injected with IGF-Trap that was pre-labeled with a fluorescent tag (CF680R (λex 680nm/λem 701 nm) and NP-encapsulated, or not (free IGF-Trap). The animals were sacrificed and the brains removed, 1–12 hr post injection and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, followed by a 3 day incubation in a 30% sucrose solution. The brains were then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and cryostat sections of 10 μm thickness were prepared. The sections were immunostained with a rat anti-mouse CD31 antibody (BD Biosciences, cat# 550,274) followed by an AF488-conjugated anti-rat IgG secondary antibody (λex 490 nm/λem 525 nm, Invitrogen) to visualize blood vessels, counterstained with DAPI and mounted in the ProLong Gold mounting reagent. Fluorescent images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM780 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with an AxioCam camera, and analyzed by ImageJ. Male NSG mice were randomized into 3 treatment groups for injection i.v. with NP-Trap, free IGF-Trap (5 mg/kg), or vehicle (PBS). Treatment began 3 and 1 days prior to intracranial injection of 10 Cells (as indicated) were lysed using the RIPA buffer (50mM Tris (pH 7.4), 1mM EDTA, 150mM NaCl, 1% (w/v) NP-40, 2mM Na Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6. The one-way ANOVA (post-hoc test) was used to analyze results of in vitro MTT assays, the student’s t test to analyze tumor measurements and the Gehan-Brewslow-Wilcoxon test to analyze Kaplan Meier survival curves. We began by evaluating the effect of the IGF-Trap on glioma growth in vitro. GL261 and U87 MG cells were selected for this study because they are highly aggressive in vivo and recapitulate GBM phenotypes and drug responses. The IGF-Trap inhibits IGF-1 induced glioma growth in vitro. U87MG (A) and GL261 (B) cells were cultured in low (1%) FBS medium supplemented on day 0 with 10 ng/ml IGF-1 and with and without IGF-Trap that was added at 1:1 or 1:2 (IGF-1: IGF-Trap) molar ratio. Cell Proliferation was measured using the MTT assay. Results are expressed as means (± SD) fold change in OD (570 nm) relative to time 0 ( To evaluate the therapeutic effect of IGF-Trap in vivo, we began with a subcutaneous (s.c.) tumor model where tumor growth can be more directly measured. Syngeneic C57Bl/6 and NSG male mice were inoculated s.c. with 10 The IGF-Trap inhibits the growth of subcutaneously injected glioma cells. GL261 cells (B and C) and U87MG (D and E) cells (10 Having established the sensitivity of the tumor cells to IGF-Trap treatment in vitro and in vivo, we next sought to determine whether their growth in the brain could also be blocked by the IGF-Trap. To overcome the likely exclusion of circulating IGF-Trap from the brain by the BBB, we administered the IGF-Trap directly into the brain via a cannula implanted intracerebrally. GL261 cells expressing the luciferase gene were injected orthotopically into the brain (10 IGF-Trap administered intra-cerebrally inhibits the growth of orthotopically implanted glioma cells. Luciferase tagged GL261 (10 We confirmed the inhibitory effect of IGF-Trap using GBM stem cell (GSC) xenografts growing in NSG mice. Mice were injected orthotopically with the very aggressive human glioma stem cells (GSC) MES-1123 and treated as described above. Untreated mice implanted intra-cranially with 2.5 × 10 The IGF-Trap also inhibits the growth of orthotopically implanted human glioma stem cell xenografts. NSG mice were implanted intra-cerebrally with 2.5 × 10 Continuous drug administration via a cerebrally implanted cannula, while it may be effective in delivering the drug to the tumor site, is challenging in the clinical setting. Optimally, drugs should access the brain from the circulation in high enough concentrations to affect local tumor growth. However, access to large biologics such as antibodies and the IGF-Trap is hindered by the BBB. Strategies to increase penetrability of biologics into the brain for the treatment of malignant disease are therefore actively being sought. We selected to use a nanoparticle (NP)-based delivery approach for increased IGF-Trap delivery and retention in the brain. Nanocarriers have the added advantage of decreasing drug uptake and opsonization by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS). TRIOZAN™, is a polymeric nanocarrier that enables the encapsulation and protection of targeted drugs (small molecules and biologics) and was shown to improve drug delivery across the BBB. IGF-Trap encapsulation in trimethyl chitosan nanoparticles increases the uptake, stability and intra-vascular levels of the IGF-Trap in the brain. IGF-Trap was labeled with the CF680 dye and encapsulated in TRIOZAN™ nanoparticles (NP-Trap). NP-Trap and the free IGF-Trap were injected intravenously, and the biodistribution was monitored over 24 h using optical imaging. Shown in (A) are images of the injected mice acquired at the indicated time intervals and in (B) mean fluorescent signal intensity (±SD) calculated as an output of the fluorescent intensity of the selected region of interest (brain) normalized to a non-injected control mouse and taking into account the background fluorescent signal of each image. Data are expressed as fold change relative to the mean signal detected at 0.083 hr that was assigned a value of 1. In a separate experiment (C), the mice were injected i.v. with 5 mg/kg fluorescently tagged IGF-Trap encapsulated, or not in TRIOZAN™, brains removed at the indicated time intervals, cryostat sections prepared, immunostained with anti-CD31 antibodies and counter stained with DAPI. Shown (C-left) are representative confocal images acquired at the indicated time intervals post IGF-Trap injection. IGF-Trap localized within CD31 To determine the location of the IGF-Trap in the brain, the brains were removed 1 and 4 hr postinjection of NP-encapsulated or free IGF-Trap, cryostat sections were prepared, stained with an antibody to CD31 to identify vascular structures and analyzed using confocal microscopy. Within 1 hr of the injection, fluorescently labeled IGF-Trap could be observed within, or in proximity to brain blood vessels, in both treatment groups ( Finally, having documented a more prolonged retention of NP-encapsulated IGF-Trap in the brain and localization within, and adjacent to vascular structures, we assessed the effect of the encapsulated IGF-Trap on intracerebral tumor growth. Mice were injected intracerebrally with GL261 cells and treated with encapsulated or free IGF-Trap, using the regimen outlined in  Nanoparticle-encapsulated IGF-Trap administered systemically inhibits intracerebral tumor growth and extends animal survival. Male NSG mice were divided into 3 treatment groups that were injected i.v. with free IGF-Trap, NP-Trap each at a dose calculated to deliver 5 mg/kg, or vehicle (PBS) using the regimen shown in (A). They were then injected intra-cerebrally with 10 Drug delivery to the brain remains a major challenge due to the limited diffusion through the BBB and strategies are therefore being sought for transiently breaching the BBB to increase drug access to the brain for the treatment of primary and metastatic tumors. Here we show that the intracerebral growth of aggressive human gliomas and patient-derived glioma stem cells could be inhibited by the direct intracranial administration of the IGF-Trap, consistent with the documented role of the IGF- axis in glioma progression. Of note are our results with MES-1123—the highly aggressive patient-derived glioma stem cells. We found a modest (but significant) increase in the survival of mice injected orthotopically with these cells, when treated with the IGF-Trap. In view of their rapid growth, whereby all control mice were at humane end point by 12 days post injection, our results suggest that targeting the IGF-axis may be clinically beneficial, particularly if enough of the drug can reach the tumor site. Similar results were reported by Zamykal et al, using mice that were orthotopically implanted with U87 cells and treated with the IGF-1R targeting antibody IMC-A12 delivered to the tumor site via an intra-cerebrally implanted catheter. Continuous direct intracranial drug delivery is clinically challenging. We therefore sought to use a non-invasive method to optimize the potential clinical utility of the IGF-Trap for GBM treatment. Nanomedicine has emerged as an important platform for increasing drug delivery and efficacy for cancer treatment. In contrast to other studies where the levels of N-trimethyl chitosan-encapsulated agents in the brain were evaluated postmortem, We observed that the injection of free IGF-Trap intravenously also reduced the intracerebral growth of the GL261 tumors, although the effect did not reach statistical significance when compared to vehicle-treated mice. This, more modest, effect may be due to the reduction in the bioavailability of circulating IGF-1 and IGF-2 that can cross the BBB due to their small size (7–7.5 kD) In this study, when administering IGF-Trap systemically (as free IGF-Trap or NP-encapsulated), we pretreated the mice prior to intracerebral tumor cell injection in order to reduce the bioavailability of locally produced ligands in the brain. We therefore cannot rule out the possibility that IGF-Trap in this setting, also affected initial tumor cell engraftment in the brain. Although this treatment regimen is obviously impracticable in the clinical setting for the management of primary GBM, it may have utility in prevention of tumor recurrence. Furthermore, in this study, we used IGF-Trap as a monotherapy. In the clinical setting, given the aggressive nature of this disease, IGF-Trap is likely to be most effective when combined with other modalities such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. In those settings, when tumor volume is reduced and its outgrowth is inhibited by additional treatment regimens, pretreatment with IGF-Trap or long-term sustained treatment may not be required to achieve optimal disease management. Other studies have also documented increased drug delivery and potency when the target agents were encapsulated in trimethyl chitosan-based formulations. For example, trimethyl chitosan-encapsulated retinoic acid was used to treat glioblastoma cells in vitro and this resulted in increased cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and necrosis. Finally, our findings may have clinical implications beyond the treatment of GBM, as nanomedicine may enable delivery of targeted drugs to the brain for the treatment of metastases from other malignancies such as breast carcinoma and melanoma, where antibodies and other drugs with known therapeutic efficacy against the primary tumor and non-cerebral metastases are already in routine use in the clinic.

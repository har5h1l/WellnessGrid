VALUES ('Medicines used in the treatment of opioid dependence', 'Opioid dependence is a chronic condition that can lead to significant harm if left untreated. People who experience opioid dependence and the treatments themselves are highly stigmatised. Person-centred trauma-informed services are critical to therapeutic engagement and effectiveness. Buprenorphine and methadone are highly effective, evidence-based medicines for opioid dependence. In recent years, long-acting injectable buprenorphine has emerged as a safe and effective treatment option, offering flexible weekly or monthly dosing. The long-term treatment of opioid dependence can be undertaken in primary care settings. General practitioner and nurse practitioner prescribing, and community pharmacist dispensing, are essential for ongoing care. Australian jurisdictions have differing regulations that guide the prescribing of medicines for opioid dependence. Health professionals should be familiar with their local jurisdiction’s guidelines as well as the national guidelines. Drug and alcohol telephone services are available in each jurisdiction and can provide advice to health professionals. Opioid dependence is a chronic relapsing medical condition. According to the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases 11th revision (ICD-11), the diagnosis of opioid dependence has 3 main facets: loss of control, salience, and physiological factors of neuroadaptation (tolerance and withdrawal) ( Diagnosis of opioid dependence requires 2 out of 3 of the following: People can develop opioid dependence from illicit and pharmaceutical opioids, both prescribed and non-prescribed. Opioid dependence is a stigmatised condition. The experience of stigma and discrimination adversely affects health and prevents people from disclosing behaviours and accessing or staying in treatment. Opioid dependence treatment (ODT) with long-term prescribed opioids, such as buprenorphine or methadone, is highly effective and reduces the health, social and economic harms for people experiencing opioid dependence, In Australia, nearly 75% of ODT is provided in primary care settings. Most prescribers are general practitioners (GPs) with a small but increasing number of nurse practitioners (NPs). As ODT is highly effective, many people will greatly improve and can transition to ongoing treatment in primary care. Treatment in the primary care setting reduces stigma and enables better management of people’s general health care. A core role for primary care is the long-term management of people particularly whose ODT has stabilised. Ensuring good connections and collaboration between GPs, NPs, community pharmacists and local AOD specialist settings for consultation, advice and support, which may be virtual, is essential. Planned opioid withdrawal may be suitable for people who are using low doses of opioids (i.e. oral morphine equivalent daily dose less than 60 mg) or have a short history of opioid dependence (weeks to months); however, this approach is associated with a high risk of relapse and overdose due to loss of opioid tolerance. It is essential to consider the optimal setting for withdrawal for each person. People with other morbidities, experiencing homelessness or needing intensive psychological support, may do better in a supported setting, for example, in a public or non-government drug and alcohol inpatient unit. For support and more information, contact the AOD specialist advisory service in your jurisdiction. Medicines approved in Australia for the treatment of opioid dependence include methadone and buprenorphine ( ODT requires supervised medication administration (dosing). This can occur in drug and alcohol clinics, and in hospital or community pharmacies. Generally, people who commence oral or sublingual therapies will start with daily supervised dosing and be given doses to take away, to administer themselves at home, once they are stable in treatment. Stability is indicated by stable social conditions, stable physical and mental health, no high-risk drug use, attendance at planned appointments and good adherence to medication. Safe storage of takeaway medicines to prevent child poisoning is important. Generally, the choice of treatment should be a shared decision between the prescriber and the person seeking treatment, taking into account their unique needs, comorbidities, medications and preferences. Buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist, has a high affinity for opioid receptors and only partially activates them. This means that if a person with opioid dependence has high concentrations of opioid agonists (e.g. morphine, heroin) in their body, adding buprenorphine will displace the other opioid from the receptors, triggering opioid withdrawal symptoms (a condition called precipitated withdrawal). In contrast, if an opioid-dependent person presents with opioid withdrawal symptoms, buprenorphine will relieve these. Given the pharmacology of buprenorphine, care is needed to ensure that the person is in mild to moderate opioid withdrawal (COWS score of at least 10 to 15; refer to Appendix) before starting treatment to avoid precipitated withdrawal. Once above a certain daily dose, usually 16 mg, buprenorphine blocks the effects of other opioids, so it may be suitable for people who do not want to continue using other opioids. Buprenorphine may also assist with clarity of thought, making it a good option for those who need better cognitive function. Buprenorphine can be prescribed as a sublingual tablet or film and is usually combined with naloxone ( Long-acting injectable buprenorphine (LAIB) was first introduced in Australia in 2018. It is available as weekly or monthly subcutaneous injections. There are 2 formulations, with the trade names Buvidal and Sublocade ( Generally, sublingual buprenorphine+naloxone is started before transitioning the person to a LAIB. However, practice is evolving, and it is likely in the future that people may be started directly on a LAIB, with those who have not previously been exposed to buprenorphine receiving a test dose of sublingual buprenorphine+naloxone to exclude allergy prior to starting a LAIB. For further details on how to start LAIBs, refer to your jurisdiction’s guidelines. Methadone is a full opioid agonist ( There are 2 oral formulations of methadone: methadone syrup and Biodone liquid. Injected use is associated with infection and vein damage. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist with limited use in ODT. It may be used as adjunctive therapy in the maintenance of abstinence from opioids for people with a history of opioid dependence who have fully withdrawn from opioids. It has increased overdose risk and is not subsidised on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) for opioid dependence. Oral naltrexone is more commonly used in Australia for alcohol dependence relapse prevention. Like other opioids, methadone and buprenorphine can cause sedation, light-headedness, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, hypotension and, rarely, biliary or renal tract spasm. There is an increased risk of sedation and respiratory depression when methadone is used with other sedatives (e.g. benzodiazepines, alcohol). Buprenorphine is less sedating and is preferred if a particular risk of sedation exists. Methadone, and to a lesser extent buprenorphine, can cause QT interval prolongation, increasing the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. Therefore, methadone and buprenorphine must be used with caution, and electrocardiogram monitoring and AOD specialist advice sought when used in combination with other medications or substances that also prolongate the QT interval (e.g. alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines). Methadone and buprenorphine are both metabolised by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Medicines that induce or inhibit CYP enzymes (e.g. antiepileptics, steroids, antibiotics, nicotine, omeprazole, cimetidine) can result in under- or overdosing of methadone or buprenorphine. The impact of hepatic metabolism is less marked in buprenorphine and there appear to be fewer clinically relevant drug interactions with buprenorphine compared with methadone. ODT is long term, and for some, it is lifelong. Some people may wish to gradually stop treatment. This is best done when people have stable mental and physical health and are housed with good social connections and purpose. LAIBs may be preferred due to their long duration of action after the last dose which can mitigate the experience of withdrawal. Discharge planning should include advice and education around relapse prevention, overdose risk management, and follow-up as needed. There are ODT programs in every state and territory in Australia. These programs provide controlled supply of ODT under robust legal and regulatory frameworks to facilitate access to treatment and minimise unsanctioned supply and leakage into informal drug markets. The programs’ fundamental approach involves significant supervision of patient progress and medication administration. In some jurisdictions, there are state-funded services that focus on people presenting with complex issues (e.g. multimorbidity, polysubstance use, unstable mental and physical health) and provide free care by multidisciplinary teams. Policies, guidelines and training requirements vary between jurisdictions. Health professionals should refer to their local jurisdiction’s guidelines and requirements for prescribing and training ( Non-trained prescribers can provide care for up to 5 people. Training must be undertaken to become endorsed to prescribe for more than 5 people. Training:  Non-trained prescribers can provide care for up to 10 people stable on methadone and start or continue treatment for up to 20 people on buprenorphine. Accredited prescribers who have undertaken training can prescribe for 200 people. Training:  Three types of prescribers: full, shared care and temporary. Training:  Non-trained prescribers and nurse practitioners (in scope) can prescribe buprenorphine+naloxone formulations for up to 10 people. Training:  Training is needed to prescribe. Contact the  All medical practitioners and authorised nurse practitioners, supported by a  All prescribers must complete training to be able to prescribe for up to 50 people. Contact the  Community pharmacists and pharmacies are integral to ODT, providing 85% of ODT (supply, dispensing and administration) across Australia. Prior to July 2023, the cost of supplying, dispensing and administering ODT medicines in the community pharmacy setting was borne by the person in treatment. This typically costed between $120 and $210 per month. In July 2023, ODT medicines became part of the Section 100 Highly Specialised Drugs Program (Community Access) arrangements, allowing eligible people to pay the PBS co-payment for up to 28 days supply and a maximum of 5 repeats. Currently, there are no Medicare item numbers for LAIB administration for medical or nurse practitioners; however, pharmacists are able to claim fees for supplying ODT medicines and administering LAIBs under the  Each jurisdiction in Australia has drug and alcohol telephone services that can provide information, support and clinical advice in real time to health professionals ( Buprenorphine and methadone are highly effective, evidence-based treatments for people experiencing opioid dependence. Most people can be effectively managed by GPs and NPs working in primary care, while those with more complex needs may benefit from initial AOD specialist care and transfer to primary care once their complexity has settled. It can be highly rewarding work for the health professionals involved. Support and advice through local AOD specialist services and jurisdictional telephone lines are available. Health professionals should refer to jurisdictional regulations and guidelines when providing care. Access to treatment remains limited, and the engagement of GPs, NPs and pharmacists is crucial to ensure all who need it can receive treatment in the setting most suited to their needs.

VALUES ('DIABETES Guidelines: Type 2', 'About Diabetes Understanding Type 2 Diabetes What is Type 2 Diabetes?In type 2 diabetes, your body does not use insulin properly—this is called insulin resistance. At first, your beta cells make extra insulin to make up for it. Over time, your pancreas can’t make enough insulin to keep your blood glucose at normal levels. Type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older adults but is increasing in young people.Treatment for people with type 2 diabetes will include healthy eating and exercise. However, your health care provider may need to also prescribe oral and injectable medications (including insulin) to help you meet your target blood glucose levels.Symptoms of Type 2 DiabetesThe following symptoms of diabetes are typical. However, some people with type 2 diabetes have symptoms so mild that they go unnoticed.Common symptoms of diabetes:Urinating oftenFeeling very thirstyFeeling very hungry—even though you are eatingExtreme fatigueBlurry visionCuts/bruises that are slow to healTingling, pain, or numbness in the hands/feet Early detection and treatment of diabetes can decrease the risk of developing the complications of diabetes.Although there are many similarities between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the cause of each is very different. And the treatment is usually quite different, too. Some people, especially adults who are newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, may have symptoms similar to type 2 diabetes and this overlap between types can be confusing. Take our Risk Test to find out if you are at increased risk for having type 2 diabetes.Maybe it’s a different typeIf you or someone you know is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes but isn’t responding well to the typical treatments for type 2 diabetes, it may be worth a visit to an endocrinologist to determine what type of diabetes is happening. Generally, this requires antibody tests and possibly the measurement of a C-peptide level.Gestational diabetesWomen with gestational diabetes often have no symptoms, which is why it''s important for at-risk women to be tested at the proper time during pregnancy.Learn more about Gestational DiabetesSymptoms of diabetes complicationsHave you already been diagnosed with diabetes but are concerned about symptoms that may be the result of complications related to diabetes?Learn more about diabetes complications Give Today and Change lives!

VALUES ('PSYCHIATRY Guidelines: Depression', 'Depression Learn about depression, including symptoms, risk factors, treatment options and answers to your questions. ver en español Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, think, act, and perceive the world. Symptoms of depression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can appear differently in each person. These symptoms can include: Feeling sad, irritable, empty and/or hopeless. Losing interest or pleasure in activities you once enjoyed. A significant change in appetite (eating much less or more than usual) and/or weight (notable loss or gain unrelated to dieting). Sleeping too little or too much. Decreased energy or increased tiredness or fatigue. Increase in purposeless physical activity (e.g., inability to sit still, pacing, handwringing) or slowed movements and speech that are enough to be observed by others. Feeling worthless or excessively guilty. Difficulty thinking or concentrating, forgetfulness, and/or difficulty making minor decisions. Thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempts. Learn more Expert Q&A: Depression What is the difference between normal sadness or grieving and depression? Everyone experiences a range of emotions over the course of days and weeks, typically varying based on events and circumstances. When disappointed, we usually feel sad. When we suffer a loss, we grieve. Normally these feelings ebb and flow. By contrast, depression tends to feel heavy and constant. People who are depressed are less likely to be cheered, comforted or consoled. What does ''high-functioning depression" mean? The term “high-functioning depression” underscores the reality that many individuals with depression face – going through the motions of their day to day lives, appearing normal on the surface, while silently struggling with symptoms of depression. However, it is critical to note that though this term has gained prominence on various social media platforms and may be helping to lessen the stigma of depression, it is not a specific medical diagnosis. Once a person has been diagnosed and treated for depression, is it likely to return? Among people who are treated for major depressive disorder and recover, at least half are likely to experience a recurrent episode sometime in their future.It is difficult to determine at what point this may occur or what circumstances, if any, may trdigger it. If a person experiences several episodes of major depression, a psychiatrist or other mental health professional may suggest long-term treatment. What kinds of treatments work for depression? A wide variety of treatments have been proven effective in treating depression. Some involve talking and behavioral change. Others involve taking medications. There are also techniques that focus on neuromodulation, which incorporates electrical, magnetic or other forms of energy to stimulate brain pathways. Examples of neuromodulation include electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), vagus-nerve stimulation (VNS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and deep-brain stimulation (DBS). The choice of therapy should be guided by the nature and severity of depression, past responses to treatment, and the preferences of the individual in treatment. What do I need to tell my doctor when discussing my feelings of depression? Total openness is important. You should talk to your healthcare professional about all of your symptoms, important milestones in your life and any history of abuse or trauma. Also tell your them about past history of depression or other emotional symptoms in yourself or family members, medical history, medications you are taking — prescribed or over-the-counter. It is also key to share how depression has affected your daily life and whether you have ever thought about suicide. How long should I wait before I go and see a medical professional? It is important to see a healthcare professional as soon as you notice significant changes in your mood, difficulties in your work/school or home life, or if those close to you have commented about any concerning changes in your mood, personality and/or behavior. More serious symptoms, such as suicidal thinking, require immediate attention.

VALUES ('PSYCHIATRY Guidelines: Anxiety Disorders', 'Learn about anxiety disorders, including symptoms, risk factors, treatment options and answers to your questions. Anxiety is a normal reaction to stress. Mild levels can be beneficial in some situations. It can alert us to dangers and help us prepare and pay attention. Anxiety disorders differ from normal feelings of nervousness or anxiousness and involve excessive fear or anxiety. Anxiety disorders are the most common of mental disorders and affect nearly 30 percent of adults at some point in their lives. Anxiety disorders can cause people into try to avoid situations that trigger or worsen their symptoms. Job performance, schoolwork and personal relationships can be affected. However, anxiety disorders are treatable with a number of psychotherapeutic treatments. Treatment helps most people lead normal productive lives. There are several types of anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, specific phobias, agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, and selective mutism. Learn more Expert Q&A: Anxiety Disorders What''s the difference between normal anxiety and an anxiety disorder? It is normal for people to experience anxiety and have worries about different aspects of their lives. If you remember back to a time when you had a big exam or presentation, it is normal to feel nervous or on edge. The difference between normal anxiety and an anxiety disorder is when anxiety becomes persistent or recurrent, preventing you from full participation in life. Anxiety can range from relatively mild (occasional “butterflies,” jitteriness, accompanied by a sense of unease) to severe (frequent, disabling panic attacks). Severe anxiety disorders can lead someone to alter his or her lifestyle to accommodate the anxiety, for example avoiding activities. When anxiety begins to cause dysfunction in your daily life, that’s when it’s time to consider it’s more than normal anxiety. Can meditation or other relaxation techniques help with my anxiety? Relaxation techniques and meditation can certainly help with your anxiety. In fact, non-medication options are the first-line treatment for the mild anxiety that most of us experience from time to time. There are many books, online resources, and apps with relaxation exercises (often paired with deep breathing) and meditation guidance. They are relatively simple to learn, yet highly effective. These approaches can provide relief and can be used anywhere once the person understands the method. Mental health professionals can guide the person who needs a more personal approach to learning relaxation or meditation. Are there medications that can help with panic attacks? Yes. There are many medications that have FDA approval to treat anxiety disorders. For individuals who prefer medication, it is recommended to start with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). There is no evidence for any particular SSRI being better than another. This class of medications is not only helpful for panic attacks, but it’s also first-line treatment for generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, and social anxiety disorder. They can be quite effective and have few side effects, although it takes a few weeks to start noticing their benefit. In the past, benzodiazepines were commonly used to provide relief from anxiety. However, best practice today is to consider these medications when there’s been a partial response to an initial medication option. In these cases, a long-acting benzodiazepine is preferred. While these medications are effective, they should be used for short-term relief. They have many side effects, including drowsiness, and can be habit-forming at higher doses. People taking these medications should not use heavy machinery or drive until they understand how the medication might affect them. How are children with anxiety disorders treated? Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is indicated for all of the childhood anxiety disorders. Therapy alone can be an effective treatment for mild cases. For more moderate to severe anxiety, first-line treatment for children who require medication management for an anxiety disorder is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Are there any supplements that can help treat my child’s anxiety? While there are some supplements that may be considered for helping anxiety symptoms in children, it’s essential to consult with your physician before starting any new supplement regimen.

When the heart stops, essential functions fail, some almost instantly. Given the heart''s never-ending workload, it''s a wonder it performs so well, for so long, for so many people.

Sugar builds up in the bloodstream. High blood sugar can have immediate effects, like blurry vision. It can also cause problems over time, like heart disease and blindness. There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes .

When you digest your food, chemical processes take place in your body that break down food, primarily carbohydrates, into sugars, or glucose. Glucose is an important fuel for cells throughout your body. But those cells can''t get access to this critical fuel source without a substance, produced naturally by your pancreas, called insulin. In someone without diabetes, an increase in blood sugar, usually after a meal, causes the pancreas to release insulin into the bloodstream so that glucose can move into the body''s cells and be used as fuel.

Once the sugar is in the cells and no longer in the bloodstream, the person has normal glucose levels. But with diabetes, that process stops working, either because the pancreas fails to produce sufficient insulin, or because the body''s cells become resistant to insulin (or both).

How is prediabetes diagnosed ? Doctors use the same tests for prediabetes as they do for diabetes. Most such tests measure the amount of glucose in the blood, expressed as micrograms per deciliter, or mc/dL. A reading above the normal range but not yet in the range of diabetes results in a prediabetes diagnosis. For example, on a fasting glucose test, a normal level would be below 100 mc/dL, prediabetes would be diagnosed for someone in the range of 100-125 mc/dL, and someone with a result higher than 125 mc/dL would receive a diabetes diagnosis. etes would be diagnosed for someone in the range of 100-125 mc/dL, and someone with a result higher than 125 mc/dL would receive a diabetes diagnosis. Another test to diagnose prediabetes is a blood test that measures hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c). This test can be done any time during the day and does not require fasting. It reflects your average blood sugar over the past three months. A normal reading is below 5.7%. A reading of 5.7% to 6.4% means prediabetes, and people with diabetes have reading of 6.5% or higher.

Diabetes symptoms don''t always appear until the disease has progressed, which is why it''s important to have a periodic wellness visit with your primary care clinician that includes lab work.

This happens because the kidneys must release the extra glucose into the urine. That means the kidneys need to also release large amounts of water along with the glucose. Expelling so much fluid makes you dehydrated, which is why you become so thirsty.

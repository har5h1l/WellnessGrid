COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is a group of lung diseases that make it hard to breathe and get worse over time. Normally, the airways and air sacs in your lungs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, the airways bring air to the air sacs. The air sacs fill up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate, and the air goes out. ways bring air to the air sacs. The air sacs fill up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate, and the air goes out. If you have COPD, less air flows in and out of your airways because of one or more problems: The airways and air sacs in your lungs become less elastic The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed The airways make more mucus than usual and can become clogged What are the types of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?

Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. rt beats, it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is called diastolic pressure. Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually the systolic number comes before or above the diastolic number. For example, 120/80 means a systolic of 120 and a diastolic of 80. How is high blood pressure diagnosed? High blood pressure usually has no symptoms.

Different types of lipoproteins have different purposes: HDL stands for high-density lipoprotein. It is sometimes called "good" cholesterol because it helps your body get rid of cholesterol. It carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Your liver then removes the cholesterol from your body. LDL stands for low-density lipoprotein.

It is sometimes called "bad" cholesterol because a high LDL level leads to the buildup of plaque in your arteries. VLDL stands for very low-density lipoprotein. Some people also call VLDL a "bad" cholesterol because it too contributes to the buildup of plaque in your arteries.

A stroke happens when there is a loss of blood flow to part of the brain. Your brain cells cannot get the oxygen and nutrients they need from blood, and they start to die within a few minutes. This can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death. If you think that you or someone else is having a stroke, call 911 right away. is can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death. If you think that you or someone else is having a stroke, call 911 right away. Immediate treatment may save someone''s life and increase the chances for successful rehabilitation and recovery. What are the types of stroke? There are two types of stroke: Ischemic stroke is caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain.

Asthma is a chronic (long-term) lung disease. It affects your airways, the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. When you have asthma, your airways can become inflamed and narrowed.

Bladder cancer occurs when cells in the bladder start to grow without control. The bladder is a hollow, balloon-shaped organ in the lower part of the abdomen that stores urine. The bladder has a muscular wall that allows it to get larger to store urine made by the kidneys and to shrink to squeeze urine out of the body. There are two kidneys, one on each side of the backbone, above the waist. The bladder and kidneys work together to remove toxins and wastes from your body through urine: Tiny tubules in the kidneys filter and clean the blood. These tubules take out waste products and make urine. The urine passes from each kidney through a long tube called a ureter into the bladder. e blood.

A reading above the normal range but not yet in the range of diabetes results in a prediabetes diagnosis. For example, on a fasting glucose test, a normal level would be below 100 mc/dL, prediabetes would be diagnosed for someone in the range of 100-125 mc/dL, and someone with a result higher than 125 mc/dL would receive a diabetes diagnosis. etes would be diagnosed for someone in the range of 100-125 mc/dL, and someone with a result higher than 125 mc/dL would receive a diabetes diagnosis.

Diabetes symptoms don''t always appear until the disease has progressed, which is why it''s important to have a periodic wellness visit with your primary care clinician that includes lab work. The earlier the disease is detected, the better able you''ll be to manage it. One of the key diabetes signs is a cluster of symptoms that include excessive thirst and urination. This happens because the kidneys must release the extra glucose into the urine. is a cluster of symptoms that include excessive thirst and urination. This happens because the kidneys must release the extra glucose into the urine. That means the kidneys need to also release large amounts of water along with the glucose. Expelling so much fluid makes you dehydrated, which is why you become so thirsty.

Carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars, primarily glucose. Glucose is a critically important source of energy for the body''s cells. To provide energy to the cells, glucose needs to leave the blood and get inside the cells. The hormone insulin produced by the pancreas and released into the bloodstream signals the body''s cells to take up glucose.

Subgroup analyses confirmed consistent associations across various demographic and clinical subgroups. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that WWI had superior discrimination ability compared to BMI and WC, with higher area under the curve (AUC) values for SUI (AUC = 0.601), UUI (AUC = 0.630), and MUI (AUC = 0.628). ination ability compared to BMI and WC, with higher area under the curve (AUC) values for SUI (AUC = 0.601), UUI (AUC = 0.630), and MUI (AUC = 0.628). In conclusion, this study highlights a significant association between higher WWI and increased risks of SUI, UUI, and MUI in women. WWI may serve as a more effective anthropometric indicator for assessing UI risk compared to traditional measures like BMI and WC, offering potential utility in clinical and public health settings for identifying individuals at higher risk of UI and guiding targeted prevention strategies.', 'PubMed_Central', 'nutrition guidelines', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC', 'research_abstract', 'scientific_literature', '2025-06-26T12:59:43.260193', 'c5aa1759d522c37196c8c54607063c84', 0, '2025-06-26T13:03:18.336376', '2025-06-26T13:03:18.336377');

This study aimed to assess the changes in the epidemiology of HL in Finland at the population level by utilizing data from six nationwide healthcare registries. A total of 2912 patients with HL, diagnosed and treated between 2000 and 2019 were matched by controls and divided into younger (<50 years) and older cohorts (≥50 years) for analysis. A slightly increasing trend in incidence per age group was observed. For the younger patients, the mean annual incidence was 3.19 for males and 2.89 for females.

Bipolar disorder (formerly called manic-depressive illness or manic depression) is a mental illness that causes clear shifts in a person’s mood, energy, activity levels, and concentration. People with bipolar disorder often experience periods of extremely “up,” elated, irritable, or energized behavior (known as manic episodes) and very “down,” sad, indifferent, or hopeless periods (known as depressive episodes). Where can I learn more about bipolar disorder? Free health information Brochures and fact sheets with more information about bipolar disorder, including signs, symptoms, and treatment options. Available for free in print and online. Science updates NIMH news about bipolar disorder, including press releases and highlights on the latest research findings. Statistics Information about the prevalence and treatment of bipolar disorder in the United States. Why is NIMH studying bipolar disorder? The symptoms of bipolar disorder can impose serious challenges to a person’s mental and physical health. People with bipolar disorder often have other mental disorders, and some people may experience symptoms of psychosis, such as hallucinations or delusions. The symptoms can interfere with everyday activities, relationships, and work or school responsibilities. Some people may also experience stigma related to their symptoms, which can keep them from seeking the help they need.Bipolar disorder usually requires lifelong treatment, but an effective treatment plan can help people manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life. How is NIMH research addressing this critical topic? NIMH supports research to understand the biological, genetic, and environmental factors that contribute to bipolar disorder. This research includes studies examining how different factors influence when bipolar disorder symptoms appear and how they change over time. Other research focuses on identifying patterns in brain activity that could help predict and track symptom progression.NIMH also supports research to improve treatments for people with bipolar disorder. This includes research to better understand the relationship between bipolar disorder and co-occurring conditions, like anxiety disorders and substance use disorders. Understanding the relationship between these conditions could lead to more effective treatment approaches.

VALUES ('HEART Guidelines: What Is Cardiovascular Disease', 'Cardiovascular disease can refer to a number of conditions: Heart disease Heart and blood vessel disease, also called heart disease, includes numerous problems, many of which are related to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a condition that develops when a substance called plaque builds up in the walls of the arteries. This buildup narrows the arteries, making it harder for blood to flow through. If a blood clot forms, it can block the blood flow. This can cause a heart attack or stroke. Heart attack A heart attack occurs when the blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked by a blood clot. If this clot cuts off the blood flow completely, the part of the heart muscle supplied by that artery begins to die. Most people survive their first heart attack and return to their normal lives, enjoying many more productive years. But having a heart attack does mean that you need to make some changes. The medications and lifestyle changes that your health care professional recommends may vary according to how badly your heart was damaged, and to what degree of heart disease caused the heart attack. Learn more about heart attack. Stroke An ischemic stroke, which is the most common type of stroke, occurs when a blood vessel that feeds the brain gets blocked, usually from a blood clot. When the blood supply to a part of the brain is cut off, some brain cells will begin to die. This can result in the loss of functions controlled by that part of the brain, such as walking or talking. A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel within the brain bursts. This is most often caused by uncontrolled high blood pressure. Some effects of stroke are permanent if too many brain cells die after being starved of oxygen. These cells are never replaced. The good news is that sometimes brain cells don’t die during stroke — instead, the damage is temporary. Over time, as injured cells repair themselves, previously impaired function improves. In other cases, undamaged brain cells nearby may take over for the areas of the brain that were injured. Either way, strength may return, speech may get better and memory may improve. This recovery process is what stroke rehabilitation is all about. Learn more about stroke. Heart failure Heart failure, sometimes called congestive heart failure, means the heart isn’t pumping blood as well as it should. Heart failure does not mean that the heart stops beating — that’s a common misperception. Instead, the heart keeps working, but the body’s need for blood and oxygen isn’t being met. Heart failure can get worse if left untreated. If your loved one has heart failure, it’s very important to follow their health care professional’s treatment plan. Learn more about heart failure. Arrhythmia Arrhythmia refers to an abnormal heart rhythm. There are various types of arrhythmias. The heart can beat too slow, too fast or irregularly. Bradycardia, or a heart rate that’s too slow, is when the heart rate is less than 60 beats per minute. Tachycardia, or a heart rate that’s too fast, refers to a heart rate of more than 100 beats per minute. An arrhythmia can affect how well your heart works. With an irregular heartbeat, your heart may not be able to pump enough blood to meet your body’s needs. Learn more about arrhythmia. Heart valve problems When heart valves don’t open enough to allow the blood to flow through as it should, a condition called stenosis results. When the heart valves don’t close properly and thus allow blood to leak through, it’s called regurgitation. If the valve leaflets bulge or prolapse back into the upper chamber, it’s a condition called prolapse. Discover more about the roles your heart valves play in healthy circulation. Learn more about heart valve disease. Common treatments Here are some common treatments for different types of cardiovascular disease: Heart valve problems Medications Heart valve surgery Arrhythmia Medications Pacemaker Electric cardioversion Catheter ablation Lifestyle changes Heart attack Medications Coronary angioplasty Coronary artery bypass graft surgery Heart transplant or other heart surgery Radiofrequency ablation Stent procedure Transmyocardial revascularization Lifestyle changes Stroke Medications Carotid endarterectomy (PDF)(link opens in new window) Thrombectomy Aneurysm clipping Coil embolization Blood transfusion Lifestyle changes Diagnostic tests, surgical procedures and medications In the hospital and during the first few weeks at home, your health care professional may perform several tests and procedures. These tests help them determine what caused the stroke or heart attack, and how much damage was done. Some tests monitor your progress to see if the treatment is working. Learn more about diagnostic tests and procedures. Learn more about surgical procedures that may have been performed at the hospital. Cardiac medications The medications prescribed after a cardiovascular event can aid in recovery and help prevent another heart attack or stroke. If you’re a caregiver, make sure your loved one takes their medications as directed and on time. Learn about the medications that your loved takes. Know what those medicines do, and what their goal is. It’s important to follow your health care professional’s directions closely, so ask questions and take notes.

VALUES ('DIABETES Guidelines: Type 1', 'About Diabetes Understanding Type 1 Diabetes Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. Testing, coupled with education about diabetes symptoms and close follow-up, has been shown to enable earlier diagnosis and to prevent diabetes ketoacidosis. Image What is type 1 diabetes?When you have type 1 diabetes, your immune system mistakenly treats the beta cells in your pancreas that create insulin as foreign invaders and destroys them. When enough beta cells are destroyed, your pancreas can’t make insulin or makes so little of it that you need to take insulin to live. Insulin is a hormone that helps blood glucose (blood sugar) enter your body’s cells so that it can be used as energy. If you have diabetes, blood glucose can’t enter your cells so it builds up in your bloodstream. This causes high blood glucose (hyperglycemia). Over time, high blood glucose harms your body and can lead to diabetes-related complications if not treated.Most of the time, type 1 diabetes is diagnosed in young people, but it can develop in anyone at any age. Scientists and researchers today aren’t sure how to prevent type 1 diabetes or what triggers it.If you have type 1 diabetes, you can live a long, healthy life by having a strong support system and managing it with your diabetes care team. The treatment plan you develop with your diabetes care team will include insulin, physical activity, and an eating plan to reach your health goals.Type 1 Diabetes SymptomsIf you or your child have the following symptoms of diabetes, let your health care provider know. Symptoms include:Urinating oftenFeeling very thirstyFeeling very hungry—even though you are eatingExtreme fatigueBlurry visionCuts/bruises that are slow to healWeight loss—even though you are eating moreIt’s important to know when you first develop type 1 diabetes, you may not have any symptoms at all. Choose an option Children with Type 1 Diabetes Adults with Type 1 Diabetes Learning Your Risk for Type 1 Diabetes Why Learning Your Risk Helps Image Children with type 1 diabetes will usually have the symptoms listed above. If your child is potty-trained without issues at night starts having accidents and wetting the bed again, diabetes might be the reason.Even though it’s easy to diagnose a child with diabetes by checking their blood glucose at the doctor’s office or emergency room, the tricky part is recognizing the symptoms and knowing to take your child to get checked. If you’re a parent, it’s important to know that young children, including infants, can develop type 1 diabetes.Sometimes children can be in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) when they are diagnosed with diabetes. When there is a lack of insulin in the body, high levels of an acid called ketones can build up. DKA is a medical emergency that usually requires hospitalization and immediate care with insulin and IV fluids. Image When an adult develops type 1 diabetes, they are often mistakenly told they have type 2 diabetes. This may be from lack of awareness that type 1 diabetes can start at any age and in people of every race, shape, weight, and size. People with type 1 diabetes who also have the classic risk factors for type 2 diabetes—such as overweight/obesity, not being physically active, having high blood pressure, or are over age 35—are often misdiagnosed. It can also be tricky because some adults with new-onset type 1 diabetes are not sick at first. Their health care provider may find an elevated blood glucose level at a routine visit and starts them on diet, exercise, and an oral medication.Early detection and treatment of diabetes can decrease the risk of developing complications both at the time of diagnosis and in the future. By knowing and recognizing the symptoms above, you can learn if you have type 1 diabetes early and avoid complications, like diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Image Did you know?Type 1 diabetes doesn’t develop only in childrenThere have been recent advances in type 1 diabetes screening and treatmentIf you have a family history of type 1 diabetes, your health care provider may suggest screening for type 1 diabetes. They will order a blood test to measure your islet autoantibodies. The test results can go one of two ways:Negative: Your health care provider will retest you in the future.Positive: Even if you get a positive result, this doesn’t mean you have type 1 diabetes. Your health care provider will refer you to counseling about the risk of developing diabetes, diabetes symptoms, and DKA prevention. Additional testing as needed may be done to determine the course of your treatment. Image Even if you may not want to know if you, your children, or other family members are at risk for developing type 1 diabetes, there are benefits to knowing.First, you can learn more about the early warning signs of type 1 diabetes so you and your health care team can detect diabetes early—before DKA or severe illness develops. Because DKA can be life-threatening and early symptoms can be vague, knowing what to watch out for can help detect and treat DKA early or prevent it altogether.Second, there are emerging treatments and clinical trials that seek to delay the onset of type 1 diabetes in those who are at high risk. If you are at high risk for developing type 1 diabetes, it will be important to speak with an endocrinologist to learn whether these opportunities may be available and right for you. health care professionals Calling All Professionals The American Diabetes Association (ADA) convened leading experts, including endocrinologists, researchers, primary care professionals, certified diabetes care and education specialists, and mental health professionals, to understand opportunities and roadblocks to type 1 diabetes screening and awareness. The outcome of this roundtable is a report that outlines the discussion and potential opportunities for future direction. The report does not necessarily reflect official guidelines or recommendations from the American Diabetes Association or other participating organizations. Download Now Image The Honeymoon PhaseSome people with type 1 diabetes have a "honeymoon" period, a brief period of time where your body is producing enough insulin to lower blood glucose levels. The honeymoon phase usually happens after you start taking insulin and you may not need as much to manage your blood glucose. Work with your diabetes care team for treatment and care to avoid complications like hypoglycemia. A honeymoon period can last as little as a week or even up to a year. It’s important to know that the absence of symptoms doesn''t mean the diabetes is gone. The pancreas will eventually be unable to make enough insulin, and, if untreated, the symptoms will return.Is it Possible You Don''t Have Type 2 DiabetesIf you or someone you know is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes but isn’t able to manage it with the typical treatments for type 2 diabetes, it may be worth a visit to an endocrinologist to verify what type of diabetes you have. Generally, this requires antibody tests and possibly the measurement of a C-peptide level. It is important to be sure that your diagnosis is correct because that will determine your treatment plan, allowing you manage your diabetes and prevent its complications.

VALUES ('Development and validation of a molecular classifier of meningiomas', 'Meningiomas exhibit considerable clinical and biological heterogeneity. We previously identified 4 distinct molecular groups ( Using an international cohort of 1698 meningiomas, we constructed and rigorously validated a machine learning-based molecular classifier using only DNA methylation data as input. Original and newly predicted molecular groups were compared using DNA methylation, RNA sequencing, copy number profiles, whole-exome sequencing, and clinical outcomes. We show that group-specific outcomes in the validation cohort are nearly identical to those originally described, with median progression-free survival (PFS) of 7.4 (4.9–Inf) years in  Our DNA methylation-based classifier, which is publicly available for immediate clinical use, recapitulates the biology and outcomes of the original molecular groups as assessed using multiple metrics/platforms that were not used in its training. We develop a methylation-based tool to prospectively classify meningiomas into molecular groups. Predicted groups strongly recapitulate expected clinical and biological profiles. This will allow increasingly personalized care for patients with meningioma. We previously showed that molecular groups of meningioma, identified by combining multiple genomic approaches, can successfully resolve much of the disease heterogeneity that has limited translational progress in this disease to date. However, their discovery using high-dimensional clustering approaches and multi-omics data does not lend itself readily to classifying prospective cases in the clinical setting. Here we present a point-and-click tool to classify prospective meningioma cases into their respective molecular group using DNA methylation alone. Using multiple orthogonal data types including DNA methylation, RNA sequencing, exome sequencing, and clinical outcomes, we show that our model faithfully recapitulates the molecular groups that were originally described using a large, multi-institutional cohort of 1698 cases. This novel tool can be readily integrated into existing DNA methylation-based workflows to increase personalization of patient care and form the basis of molecularly-informed clinical trials for meningioma. We make this tool publicly available. Meningioma, the most common primary intracranial tumor, We previously described 4 consensus molecular groups of meningioma by integrating DNA methylation, transcriptomic, and copy number alterations (CNAs) derived from whole-exome sequencing data To address this critical gap and translate the biologic insights of these novel molecular groups into clinical practice, we focused on adapting a multiplatform description of molecular classification into a more convenient single platform approach by building a classifier that predicts meningioma molecular group classification using only raw DNA methylation files as input. We used DNA methylation to anchor this classifier since CNAs can be inferred from these data, and because methylation-based classifiers have gained considerable traction in the clinical care of brain tumor patients. The cohort for this study was generated by using a combination of previously published cases analyzed by our group, datasets made publicly available, and additional cases we obtained for this new analysis. Our total study cohort was divided into a discovery cohort and a validation cohort. The discovery cohort included a previously published cohort used to describe the original 4 molecular groups. Sample acquisition and processing have been described in detail previously. Between 250 and 500 ng of extracted DNA was bisulfite converted using the EZ DNA Methylation Kit followed by methylation profiling using the Illumina 850k EPIC array. Raw output (.idat files) were imported, preprocessed, and ssNoob normalized using the  We inferred chromosome arm-level gains and losses using the  Extracted RNA was paired-end sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 to target 70 million reads per sample. Output fastq files were aligned to the GRCh38 human reference genome using the STAR aligner. All samples in the discovery cohort, as well as prospective samples from the prospective RTOG-0539 clinical trial, underwent whole-exome sequencing. Mutational data from a publicly available cohort In addition, amplification of the  To predict molecular groups, we used elastic net classifiers which were optimized using 10-fold cross validation repeated 3 times on the discovery cohort, where the true label was defined as the original molecular group assignment. For each sample in this cohort, a predicted molecular group (MG) was generated by training models on all remaining samples ( For feature selection, differential methylation analysis was performed in a pairwise fashion between each input group label using the  Once the model configuration was determined, an elastic net classifier (a form of regularized logistic regression) was trained using the full discovery cohort and used to predict the molecular group on our combined validation cohort. The training parameters were identical to those used in the model optimization. The biological profiles of these predicted molecular groups were compared to the molecular descriptions of the original cohort using methylation, clinical, and orthogonal genomic data (RNA sequencing and somatic point mutation data from whole-exome sequencing). Inferred copy number changes were also compared between cohorts, with a specific focus on canonical MG-specific gains/losses such as loss of chromosome 1p, gain of chromosome 1q, and loss of chromosome 22q. A subset of the validation cohort with available RNA sequencing data was used as further validation of the biological recapitulation of our original molecular groups. Single sample gene set variation analysis (ssGSVA), Within the validation cohort, differential gene expression analysis was performed between each predicted molecular group and the remaining samples ( As further validation of our predicted molecular groups, we compared the inferred cell proportions in our discovery and validation cohorts using CIBERSORTx. For continuous variables, a student’s  Full details of our discovery ( Baseline Characteristics of the Discovery and Validation Cohorts Bold values indicate  Given the previous finding that  Predicted molecular groups recapitulate the methylation signatures, inferred copy number profiles, and outcomes of the original molecular groups.

To apply these trained models to our validation cohort, processed beta-values were input into model 1, and preliminary molecular groups were assigned based on the highest output probability. Cases assigned as “ Given that stereotypical CNAs were specific to some molecular groups in their original description, we refined the methylation model output using CNA data inferred from DNA methylation (effectively creating a 3-layer model using only DNA methylation as input data). Based on findings from our discovery cohort, cases with the presence of both 1p loss and either 1q gain or 10 (p or q) loss, while rare, were assigned as  We applied the complete 3-layer classifier to all samples in the validation cohort, classifying 1378/1577 (87.4%) of cases. Of these 1378 cases, 68 (4.9%) cases had final assignments that were refined by their inferred CNV profiles. Two hundred and seventy-three cases (19.8%) were classified as  Given the observation that specific chromosome arms are stereotypically gained or lost in an MG-specific manner, we also compared inferred copy number changes of our final MG predictions in the validation cohort to those described in the original discovery cohort ( Of the 199 “undifferentiated” cases which were not confidently assigned to a single group, 65 (32.7%) had final output model probabilities <0.5 and 134 (67.3%) were assigned as  We next sought to compare molecular group-specific outcomes in the validation cohort to the discovery cohort ( We next sought to further validate the biological fidelity of the predicted molecular groups using orthogonal genomic platforms, which were not used in our classifier’s training or predictions. We first investigated the somatic point mutation profiles of a subset of the validation cohort with available whole-exome sequencing ( Validation of predicted molecular groups using orthogonal genomic platforms. (A) Whole-exome sequencing reveals similar molecular group-specific patterns of mutations between cohorts, with  Given that the transcriptional profiles of the originally described consensus molecular groups were highly distinct, we used RNA sequencing to further characterize the biology of predicted molecular groups in the validation cohort ( As further confirmation of the transcriptome-level validity of our predicted molecular groups, we computed the expression of group-specific gene signatures generated during the initial discovery of these groups Finally, we inferred the relative proportions of neoplastic cells, macrophages,  The inclusion of TERT promoter mutations and CDKN2A deletions to classify meningioma represents a significant update to the longstanding histopathology-based WHO criteria. While methylation profiling is not currently part of the standard of care in meningioma management and is not available at many laboratories, it is becoming increasingly accessible as the cost of genomic profiling decreases, further mitigated by using microarray-based technologies Our institution routinely applies a previously published DNA methylation-based nomogram to stratify meningiomas into high and low risk groups, The results of our study should be considered in the context of some limitations. First, the labels in our training are based on assignments from prior clustering analyses, which are associated with inherent stochasticity. Basing our classifier on a different datatype such as RNA sequencing, furthermore, may have led to differing results; notably, DNA methylation was chosen given its increasing role in tumor classification and its ability to robustly infer copy number profiles. Tumors which are not fully encapsulated by a single molecular group in either cohort, for example, could unpredictably skew results. To mitigate this in our classifier, we have built in confidence scores that are returned to the user and return the result of “undifferentiated” for cases where prediction probabilities are low, suggesting a case that is not fully encapsulated by a single molecular group. Of course, this comes with the caveat that a small minority of patients will not have a robust molecular group assignment, and other approaches such as outcome prediction models and copy number profiling will be needed to help prognosticate those cases. Secondly, most samples collected and included in this study were done so in a retrospective manner and so the limitations of retrospective data collection remain. However, the inclusion of valuable prospectively-collected, uniformly treated samples from the RTOG-0539 trial, and the large size and multi-institutional nature of our validation cohort addresses some of these limitations. Overall, we present a novel meningioma molecular classifier using only DNA methylation data as input and rigorously demonstrate its validity using a large, multi-centered cohort of 1698 patients including samples from the prospective RTOG-0539 clinical trial. This represents an important step toward increasingly personalized care for patients with meningioma and will help usher in a new era of molecularly-stratified clinical trials.

VALUES ('Increasing incidence and prevalence of Hodgkin’s lymphoma in Finland: a population-based registry study', 'Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL) is a lymphoid malignancy with an emphasized incidence in developed countries. This study aimed to assess the changes in the epidemiology of HL in Finland at the population level by utilizing data from six nationwide healthcare registries. A total of 2912 patients with HL, diagnosed and treated between 2000 and 2019 were matched by controls and divided into younger (<50 years) and older cohorts (≥50 years) for analysis. A slightly increasing trend in incidence per age group was observed. For the younger patients, the mean annual incidence was 3.19 for males and 2.89 for females. For the older patients, it was 3.07 and 1.59, respectively. Finland has higher incidence rates than other Scandinavian countries possibly due to unique human leucocyte antigen allele distribution. There was a notable increase in prevalence. For females, this was particularly emphasized between the ages of 30–50 years, while among males, it was more evenly distributed across all ages. As a result of improved disease management, the proportion of HL survivors is increasing. Lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of cancers, classified into more than hundred subtypes according to the WHO-HAEMV5 classification [ Globally, the age-standardized incidence of all lymphomas has increased [ Prior epidemiological studies have focused on the incidence of HL; however, limited data are available on prevalence of HL and trends in occurrence over time. Reporting prevalence and incidence is significant since survivors of HL may be at risk for late morbidity [ The patient cohort included 2912 incident patients with a record of HL (the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision; ICD-10-code C81*) diagnosis in the Finnish Cancer Registry (FCR). Patients were diagnosed between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2019 in Finland and divided into two patient cohorts: the younger (age <50 years at diagnosis) and the older (age ≥50 years at diagnosis) cohorts. A 1:1-ratio age, sex, and region of Finland matched control population was created from the Digital and Population Data Services Agency (DPA). A control was considered eligible for the control cohort if he/she was alive without a lymphoma diagnosis between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2019 at the index of the corresponding case. In the corresponding cases, the controls were followed up based on the lymphoma index (lymphoma diagnosis). For <5 patients, a match with the same home municipality could not be found, therefore patients received controls without a regional match. The younger cohort included 1855 patients, of whom 53.6% (994 patients) were male. The older patient cohort included 1057 patients, of whom 65% (661 patients) were male. For prevalence calculations, we included all patients who had been diagnosed with HL and were alive in the index year. Incidence data included all patients with a first diagnosis of HL during the study period. This retrospective registry study utilized data collected from six Finnish healthcare registries: the FCR (HL diagnosis), National Institute of Health and Welfare (HL diagnosis, treatments), the Social Insurance Institution of Finland and the Finnish Centre for Pensions (daily sickness allowance, pension, etc. resources), Statistics Finland (socioeconomical status), and Digital and Population Data Services Agency (gathering of controls). These were nationwide registries, as such, the data covered the entire population of Finland (∼5.6 million in 2019). The Finnish Social and Health Data Permit Authority (Findata, permit no. THL/1541/14.02.00/2021) and Statistics Finland (data permit no. TK/3616/07.03.00/2021) granted permission for data collection. Prevalence data were extracted from the FCR by using ICD-10 code C81. Using only existing data retrieved from the registries, analyses were performed using R software version 4.0.3. Missing values were not imputed. Statistical significance was set at  Annual incidence, age-standardized annual incidence, and incidence by age group were calculated. The age-standardized annual incidence was scaled by the global distribution by the WHO [ Monthly incidences, which took into account month-length, were scaled to correspond to the annual incidence per 100 000 persons. Demographic characteristics and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) were evaluated at the index. Sociological variables (e.g. number of biological children, educational level, and socioeconomic status) were evaluated using the most recent data available before diagnosis. CCI was calculated based on comorbidities and co-diagnoses, which, compared to baseline, had been recorded during 5 years prior to HL diagnosis. The CCI was calculated from the original scoring system [ Median and first and third quartile (interquartile range) were reported for continuous variables. Categorical variables were reported as numbers and percentages. Traditional tests were used to assess the differences between patients and cohorts. The chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test was used for categorical variables and the Kruskal–Wallis test was used for continuous variables. Paired tests were not performed because of the small sample sizes of some subgroups. No multiple test correction was applied. The demographic characteristics of patients and controls are presented in  Demographic and clinical characteristics of the younger (<50 years) and older cohort (≥50 years) Small patient groups (<5 patients) were not reported in detail. The total number of patients diagnosed with HL was 2912 between 2000 and 2019. A total of 1655 patients (56.8%) were male. Of the patients, 1855 (63.7%) were under the age of 50 years and 1057 (36.3%) were 50 years or older. Of those under 50 years, 994 (53.6%) were male, and of those over 50 years, 661 (62.5%) were male. The mean annual incidence between 2000 and 2019 was 2.72 per 100 000. The annual incidence increased between 2000 and 2019 from 2.35 per 100 000 to 3.22 per 100 000 ( The annual incidence between 2000 and 2019 according to sex is presented in  (A) The annual incidence of Hodgkin’s lymphoma by sex.

 This study evaluated the trends in the incidence and prevalence of HL in the Finnish population between 2000 and 2019. Our study found two age peaks in the incidence of HL. The incidence rate increased slightly during the study period. We found a remarkable increase in the prevalence of up to two to three times in the oldest age group during study time. HL is a rare type of cancer, accounting for 0.4% of all cancers and of ∼10% of all lymphomas. Its incidence is higher in males than in females [ The aetiology of HL is incompletely understood, however, there are known risk factors. Genetic factors interfere with the aetiology of HL [ Based on our results, comorbidities were more common in patients with HL than in controls in both age groups. However, diagnostic bias cannot be excluded. Comorbidities are more likely to be diagnosed among patients with HL owing to closer medical examinations. In 2020, the global HL age-adjusted incidence rate was 0.98 per 100 000 [ In a global comparison [ The incidence of HL is lower in the USA than in Finland. In the USA, the age-adjusted incidence was 2.5 per 100 000 per year between 2016 and 2020, and decreased by ∼1.6% per year between 2010 and 2019 [ A previous registry study showed that the incidence varies seasonally, especially at higher latitudes, with the incidence being higher in winter and lower in summer [ Few studies have described the trends in the prevalence of HL [ Unfortunately, HL treatment has toxic late effects, such as secondary malignancies and cardiovascular diseases, which cause excess mortality among long-term survivors. MOPP with large-field radiotherapy, MOPP/ABV with or without radiotherapy, BEACOPP (bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, procarbazine, and prednisone) increased the risk of secondary leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, which have a poor prognosis after HL. Radiotherapy increases the risk of breast cancer. The larger the chest radiation field size or dose, the greater the risk. Alkylating chemotherapy, on the other hand, have protective effect against breast cancer. However, the risk of lung and gastrointestinal cancers increases after HL treatment. Large-dose radiotherapy to the mediastinum increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, valvular disease, pericardial disease, arrhythmia, and cardiomyopathy [ A limitation of this study is the lack of detailed treatment information. In addition, as a real-world evidence-based study, registry data and errors in recording may exist. However, these registries are, in general, comprehensive, and reliable. The strengths of our study include the possibility to combine multiple registries, high coverage of data collection and a long study period. Despite socioeconomic status, all permanent residents in Finland are entitled to public healthcare, thus the data are nationwide, covering the entire population in Finland. Each patient with a HL was matched to controls by age, sex, and region. In summary, the incidence of HL is high in Finland compared to global rates. The incidence of HL has increased slightly, whereas prevalence has increased considerably. The considerably increased prevalence has resulted in an increasing number of long-term HL survivors in Finland who require follow-up for late effects. Finland has a different incidence trend than the USA and Sweden, although there is no clear reason for this. The reason for the increase in incidence and the difference between the USA and Sweden require further investigations. We observed seasonal variation in incidence in Finland. Vitamin D’s protective role might explain this variation, however more studies are necessary to elucidate this variation.', 'PubMed_Central', 'hypertension_treatment', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/', 'research_article', '{"content_hash": "11903a5ac2a2e481", "embedding_date": "2025-06-25T14:21:33.600427", "scraper_source": "PubMed_Central", "category": "research_literature", "subcategory": "pubmed_central", "document_type": "research_article", "published_date": "", "original_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/"}', 10660);

VALUES ('Advances in research on the correlation between LTCCBs and cardiovascular diseases: A review', 'The prevalence of cardiovascular diseases has been rising globally, and various therapies have made significant strides in controlling the progression of these conditions and improving prognosis. Among these, pharmacological therapies have evolved rapidly and are increasingly integrated into clinical practice. Pharmacological treatments play a pivotal role in both basic research and clinical applications, particularly in deriving accurate conclusions from drug-related trials to address clinical challenges in drug selection and improve the cure rates of various diseases. L-type calcium channel blockers (LTCCBs) have attracted considerable research attention in recent years. With the accelerated development of novel drugs, the range of LTCCBs-based drug types has also diversified. This review aims to explore the relationship between LTCCBs and conditions such as hypertension, arrhythmias, ischemia–reperfusion injury, and cardiomyopathy, with the goal of contributing to the diversification of treatment options for cardiovascular diseases patients. Additionally, it seeks to establish a theoretical foundation for future research and the clinical application of these therapies. It is imperative to conduct a thorough analysis and in-depth discussion regarding the deficiencies in the medication process as well as various application scenarios. With the advancement of science and the introduction of novel drugs into clinical practice, it is anticipated that these developments will play a critical guiding role in the diagnosis and treatment of complex clinical diseases. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are a diverse group of drugs in terms of both structure and function, and they can be classified into dihydropyridines (e.g., nifedipine) and non-dihydropyridines (e.g., verapamil). LTCCs provide the calcium influx necessary to trigger cardiac contraction in a graded manner, regulated by the amplitude and kinetics of the L-type calcium current (ICa-L). The inactivation of LTCCs is controlled by voltage-dependent inactivation and calcium-dependent inactivation, which finely tunes calcium flux. LTCCs, also known as Cav1, are voltage-gated calcium channels that play key roles in a wide range of physiological processes, including neurotransmission, muscle contraction, and gene expression. Dysregulation of calcium channels has been implicated in neurological, cardiovascular, muscular, and psychiatric disorders. The regulation of specific biological processes also depends on the interplay between membrane potential changes and ion concentration shifts. For example, high-voltage-activated calcium channels (Cav1/Cav2) in excitable cells convert action potentials into Ca CCBs remain a cornerstone of pharmacotherapy for CVDs, with their effects demonstrated across a range of drugs. For example, nimodipine, a dihydropyridine CCBs, blocks the influx of extracellular calcium through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. In 2018, the European Society of Cardiology and the European Society of Hypertension proposed a conventional definition of hypertension, that is, BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. A large body of evidence indicates that selecting appropriate drug combinations is crucial for controlling blood pressure. LTCCBs have been widely used as antihypertensive agents in clinical practice. In recent years, many studies have focused on experimental research related to spontaneous hypertension, particularly in terms of blood pressure reduction. Wang et al, As research has progressed, studies on channel-regulating substances have gradually increased. In an experiment by Reyes et al, Arrhythmias typically refer to disturbances in the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. Sinoatrial node cardiomyocytes exhibit automatic and rhythmic electrical activity, and their rate is influenced by inputs from the autonomic nervous system. For instance, sympathetic nerves increase heart rate by activating the β-adrenergic receptor (β-ARs) signaling cascade, and LTCCs activity facilitates membrane depolarization, serving as a central target of β-ARs signaling. The development of drugs based on plant extracts has become a research hotspot in recent years. Liu et al, Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a common cause of hospital admissions and can cause significant discomfort and distress in patients. The most common types include atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentrant tachycardia, AV reentrant tachycardia, and atrial tachycardia. IR injury is a pathological process that occurs in multiple organs throughout the body, often associated with severe cellular damage and death. A considerable number of studies have demonstrated that different drugs of the same class can exert varying degrees of efficacy in specific conditions. Nessa et al Quercetin has been identified in recent years as a factor with significant therapeutic potential for myocardial IR injury. Liang et al, Significant progress has been made in the taxonomy of myocardial diseases over the past 25 years, with new cardiomyopathies, such as arrhythmogenic, restrictive, and non-compaction cardiomyopathies, being discovered and added to the updated World Health Organization classification. Ca Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic cardiomyopathy characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy in the absence of conditions such as hypertension. In conclusion, LTCCBs exhibit significant associations with a wide range of CVDs, as evidenced by the multiple studies discussed. Detailed research findings are summarized in “Table  Confirmatory studies investigating the association between LTCCBs and cardiovascular diseases. LTCCBs = L-type calcium channel blockers. As LTCCBs are a subclass of CCBs, the limitations observed in the general application of CCBs provide insight into areas where LTCCBs still require improvement. Dihydropyridine (DHP)-based CCBs are generally preferred in the long-acting formulation, as short-acting CCBs, while effective in lowering blood pressure, often accelerate heart rate and increase myocardial oxygen consumption. Common side effects include palpitations, flushing, headache, and lower limb edema, with occasional gum hyperplasia. Non-DHP CCBs, on the other hand, are typically used as first-line treatment for patients with chronic stable angina; however, due to their inhibitory effects on cardiac contractility and conduction, they are contraindicated in patients with second- or third-degree AV block and heart failure (HF). Additionally, their combined use with β-blockers can exacerbate conduction block and reduce myocardial contractility, necessitating cautious monitoring. Peripheral edema is considered one of the common adverse effects associated with CCBs, believed to be secondary to small arterial dilation, which increases capillary pressure and leads to fluid extravasation into the interstitial space, resulting in edema. Makani et al confirmed that the incidence of peripheral edema gradually increases with the duration of CCBs treatment, up to 6 months. In the long term, more than 5% of patients discontinue CCBs use due to this adverse effect. Both non-DHP CCBs and lipophilic DHP CCBs have lower incidence rates of edema. From a mechanistic perspective, non-DHP CCBs exhibit negative inotropic and negative chronotropic effects. These drugs can decrease myocardial contractility, improve ventricular filling, alleviate myocardial ischemia, and reduce left ventricular hypertrophy. Drugs like verapamil and diltiazem delay AV node conduction, increase the AV node refractory period, and are used in the treatment of hemodynamically stable SVT or recurrent SVT that cannot be terminated by adenosine or vagal maneuvers. However, in patients with pre-excitation syndrome and accessory pathway-mediated paroxysmal SVT, non-DHP CCBs may shorten the refractory period of the accessory pathway, resulting in an accelerated ventricular rate and potentially triggering ventricular fibrillation or hypotension, thus making them contraindicated in these cases. Helmer et al The use of CCBs, either as monotherapy or in combination with other cardiovascular drugs, demonstrates varying degrees of effectiveness in the treatment of chronic kidney disease complicated by hypertension. Among the combinations, CCBs combined with ACEI or ARB provide the best therapeutic outcomes, with the lowest incidence of adverse effects. However, the antihypertensive efficacy and adverse effect profiles of CCBs show considerable interindividual variability, influenced by genetic polymorphisms in genes such as  This review integrates numerous research findings to summarize how LTCCBs play important roles in the diagnosis and treatment of various CVDs. Simultaneously, an in-depth examination was performed on the various scenarios of drug application, along with an identification of potential areas for enhancement, to foster the optimization of clinical drug application in future contexts. Expanding knowledge of related molecular biological pathways and clarifying unexplored pathways to improve the combined efficacy of these drugs is essential for enhancing the therapeutic effects of drug treatments (e.g., long-acting, medium-acting, and short-acting formulations). A growing body of evidence suggests that further research is needed to confirm the specific efficacy and safety of these therapies, ensuring better adherence among patients during treatment. Moreover, the development of new LTCCBs should be accelerated to address increasingly complex disease variations. Establishing connections between natural herb-based compounds and clinically applied drugs, along with elucidating their mechanisms and targets, could expedite the development of novel drugs. Additionally, quantifying the inhibitory effects of these drugs could facilitate a new systematic classification for both existing and emerging drugs. Large-scale clinical trials on synthetic drugs of this class should be conducted, and after clarifying the molecular and genetic pathways involved, further exploration of how to optimally combine clinically applied drugs with new agents would be meaningful for enhancing therapeutic outcomes. In the future, large clinical trials could explore innovations in the pathways of normal gene functions, using point mutation genes as a starting point, which would be of even greater significance.

VALUES ('Hemichorea Associated With Nigrostriatal Dysfunction: Case Report of a Patient With an Ipsilateral Infarct in the Lenticular Nucleus and Internal Capsule', 'Hemichorea is a rare manifestation of ischemic stroke whose lesion is typically located in the contralateral basal ganglia. Its pathomechanism has not been elucidated completely; however, it may be related to nigrostriatal dysfunction. In patients with hemichorea, dopamine transporter-single photon emission computed tomography (DAT-SPECT) reportedly displayed decreased tracer accumulation in the contralateral striatum. Moreover, in exceptional cases, responsible lesions were located in the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere. This case report describes an 84-year-old man who presented with three weeks of intermittent, involuntary, and twisting movements in his right limbs. On physical examination, the patient had right-sided hemichorea without other neurological deficits. The choreic movements were more frequent in the lower limb than in the upper and provoked when he tried to take a certain posture or engaged in mental arithmetic. Magnetic resonance imaging performed on suspicion of stroke detected a right hemispheric subacute infarct in the posterior part of the lenticular nucleus and posterior limb of the internal capsule. Furthermore, DAT-SPECT revealed decreased tracer accumulation in the right striatum. He was administered oral antiplatelet medication after being diagnosed with lacunar infarction. The choreic movements gradually reduced over the next 8 months and eventually disappeared. The lesion in the lenticular nucleus and internal capsule was considered to have induced ipsilesional hemichorea, considering the temporal proximity between the hemichorea and ischemic stroke. Although DAT-SPECT findings in patients with ipsilesional hemichorea have not been reported, this case suggests that nigrostriatal dopamine dysfunction can contribute to the pathogenesis of ipsilesional hemichorea. Chorea is a hyperkinetic disorder that entails involuntary, nonrhythmic, and flowing movements in the face, neck, trunk, or limbs [ The lesion responsible for hemichorea is traditionally located in the contralateral subthalamic nucleus (STN). The presence of lesions in the cerebral cortex, caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, or thalamus can also evoke contralesional hemichorea [ Hemichorea is currently hypothesized to result from dysfunction of the hyperdirect and/or indirect pathways in the contralateral basal ganglia [ Herein, we report the rare case of a patient with ipsilesional hemichorea in whom magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected a small ischemic lesion in the lenticular nucleus and internal capsule. Moreover, DAT-SPECT revealed decreased tracer accumulation in the striatum of the symptomatic side. An 84-year-old right-handed man visited our hospital because he experienced intermittent, involuntary, and twisting movements in his right limbs for three weeks. Although the frequency of the spontaneous movements was decreasing, these movements sometimes occurred when he used chopsticks at meals or when he tried to stand up. It was not apparent whether the onset of the movements was sudden or insidious. He had a medical history of diabetes mellitus, gastric cancer that was successfully resected 5 years earlier without recurrence, and reflux esophagitis. Head trauma or neurosurgical procedures were not mentioned in the anamnesis. His familial history was unremarkable and did not include neurodegenerative diseases. The patient''s oral medications were saxagliptin 5 mg/day, mitiglinide calcium 30 mg/day, and mosapride citrate 15 mg/day. On physical examination, intermittent choreic movements were observed in his right upper and lower extremities. The movements predominantly appeared in the lower extremity of the affected side and became more apparent when he tried to adopt a certain posture or performed mental arithmetic (Supporting video ( MRI was performed on suspicion of stroke. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging revealed a high-intensity lesion in the posterior part of the right lenticular nucleus and posterior limb of the right internal capsule (arrow,  DAT-SPECT with  In the presented case, a small lesion in the lenticular nucleus and internal capsule was considered to have caused ipsilesional hemichorea because of the temporal proximity between the hemichorea and ischemic stroke. Moreover, DAT-SPECT revealed decreased tracer accumulation in the striatum of the symptomatic side. Hemichorea, a rare manifestation of ischemic stroke, is usually caused by lesions of the lenticular nucleus, STN, or cerebral cortex on the contralateral side [ The mechanism of chorea has not been completely elucidated; however, some major hypotheses can be found in the literature. The basal ganglia consist of the striatum, globus pallidus interna and externa (GPi and GPe), STN, and substantia nigra pars compacta and reticulata (SNc and SNr). According to a major hypothesis, there are three important pathways when processing information from the cerebral cortex [ Despite the unapparent causal association between dopaminergic dysfunction and hemichorea, DAT-SPECT was reported to detect decreased tracer accumulation in the contralateral striatum. An 82-year-old man with hyperglycemia (blood glucose level: 590 mg/dL) presented with left-sided hemichorea and hemiballism. MRI displayed a T1-weighted hyperintense lesion in the right putamen. Moreover, on DAT-SPECT, decreased tracer accumulation was found in the right striatum [ The mechanism of ipsilesional hemichorea remains elusive; however, some speculations have been introduced in previous articles. In an article, patients with ipsilesional hemichorea were speculated to have the congenital uncrossed pyramidal tract or active uncrossed pyramidal tract [ The current patient was a diabetic and had elevated levels of hemoglobin A1c and random blood glucose; therefore, diabetic chorea was included in the differential diagnosis. In addition, as described above, patients with diabetic chorea reportedly had decreased tracer uptake in the striatum on DAT-SPECT. However, hemoglobin A1c and random blood glucose levels of the presented case were low as compared with those reported in patients with diabetic chorea [ In this case presentation, the patient was diagnosed as having lacunar infarction and treated with oral clopidogrel. The ischemic MRI lesion was less than 20 mm in greatest diameter and located in the territory of the right basal penetrating arteries, accompanied by no apparent stenosis in the trunk and major branches of the right middle cerebral artery. These findings indicated the ischemic lesion was classified as lacunar infarction [ The mechanism of ipsilesional hemichorea has not been elucidated possibly because of its rarity. Therefore, accumulation of case reports may be important and lead to the better understanding of this infrequent chorea. A major limitation of this report is that more cases with ipsilesional chorea are necessary to obtain robust conclusions regarding the DAT-SPECT findings. In summary, this case report has demonstrated that hemichorea can be observed with an ipsilateral cerebral lesion. Moreover, the observed involuntary movements may be associated with ipsilateral nigrostriatal dopamine dysfunction.', 'PubMed_Central', 'stroke_prevention', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/', 'research_article', '{"content_hash": "67bd087a9ae155ab", "embedding_date": "2025-06-25T14:21:35.189854", "scraper_source": "PubMed_Central", "category": "research_literature", "subcategory": "pubmed_central", "document_type": "research_article", "published_date": "", "original_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/"}', 7197);

VALUES ('Identification of drug and food allergy in surgery clinic: Automation system and red wristband combination', 'Correct identification of drug and food allergies in hospitalized patients is important to prevent unwanted allergic reactions or unnecessary treatment changes. This study aimed to explain the working principle of digital patient identification systems used for drug and food allergy recording and to evaluate the results by analyzing the allergy recording system data of the general surgery clinic in our center. In our single-center, retrospective study, all patients admitted to general surgery services between January 01, 2023 and December 31, 2023 were included. Patients who were given an identifying red wristband and had allergy information on their digital patient card panel were included in the study. Patients with repeated hospitalizations within the total number of patients were included in the study as 1 patient. Data from 5810 patients hospitalized in the general surgery department for 1-year were analyzed. In total, 759 patients with allergy labels were included in this study. Of these, 241 (31.8%) were male and 518 (68.2%) were female, and the mean age was 58.81 ± 15.77 (18–96). The drug allergy, antibiotic allergy, and penicillin allergy rates were 7.2%, 3.8%, and 2.1%, respectively. Food allergy was detected in 1.5% of the total patient group. The most frequently reported allergenic foods were tomatoes, mushrooms, spices, eggs, milk and dairy products, respectively. We recommend the use of identifying wristbands, such as red wristbands, to ensure that the allergy history of hospitalized patients is correctly questioned and that patients with allergies are labeled. We also believe that protocols for allergy labels should be developed in health centers. Drug allergy (DA) is defined as a hypersensitivity reaction to drugs that is mediated by specific antibodies or T lymphocytes. Its epidemiological risk factors are not fully understood, and severe symptoms range from mild manifestations such as erythema, skin rash, pruritus to anaphylaxis, and mortality may be observed. Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are common problems in drug allergies and may deprive patients of optimal drug choices. Similar to DA, food allergy (FA) can cause symptoms ranging from mild to anaphylaxis. The basis of FA treatment is the avoidance of allergens and use of appropriate diet lists. Food-derived substances used to maintain stability or bioavailability during the manufacturing process of medicines can lead to unpredictable allergic reactions. In hospitalized patients, it is essential to question and record the patient’s history of allergy to a known drug to prevent possible medication errors. Patients may have extra allergy labels owing to vague symptoms that do not correspond to true allergic reactions or lack of information. Occasionally, allergic reactions occur when patients with allergies are not labeled. An inaccurately defined history of allergy leads to increased use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, increased potential side effects, higher risk of infection by resistant bacteria, increased treatment costs, and prolonged hospitalization. This study primarily aimed to explain the working principles of digital patient identification systems used in recording drug and food allergies of hospitalized patients. Secondly, it was aimed to analyze the data of the digital allergy recording system in the general surgery clinic and make inferences about the results. All patients admitted to general surgery services between January 01, 2023 and December 31, 2023 were included in our single-center study conducted in our hospital, which is a tertiary city hospital and the largest health center in the region. The data of the patients were retrospectively examined through the Hospital Information Management System (HIMS) used by our hospital and patient files. Our city hospital, located in a region with a population density of approximately 7 million, is the reference center and the largest health facility in the region. Our hospital is a health complex serving as a third-level training and research hospital with a total bed capacity of 2682, and 426 of which are intensive care beds, consisting of 8 different blocks. The general surgery clinic consists of 7 specialized subunits and has a total bed capacity of 168. In our hospital, colored wristbands are used to correctly identify patients within the scope of quality standards. All standard patients admitted to the units in our health facility are given a “white” colored identification wristband. If the patient has a history of allergies, a “red” wristband is worn. Different colored wristbands are also available and are used according to the medical condition and history of the patients (Fig.  Identifying patient wristbands (A) white color – for standard patients; (B) red color – for patients with allergies; (C) green color – for patients with catheters or ports; (D) QR code reading and identifying wristband printing machines. The first anamnesis of patients admitted to the clinic is taken by the physician and nurse. After a protocol number is defined for each patient via HIMS, a digital patient card is created. All previous medical records of the patient and the warning panels related to these records can be viewed on this digital screen. If the patient has an allergy history on their digital card, the warning panels are activated and a red identification wristband is automatically created for the patient (Fig.  Warning panels on the digital patient card. Allergy testing is not routinely performed on patients who report an allergy history, and allergy labels are given according to the patient’s declaration or previous medical records. On the screen where allergy information is entered, there are sections for drug allergies, food allergies, allergic diseases and other allergies (Fig.  Allergy information entry fields (arrow) and allergy warning symbol (star) on the digital patient card. Both the active ingredient information and the market name of the drug with the specified allergy are recorded in the system. The drug information entered in this field is integrated into the digital pharmacy system and all drug groups containing the active ingredient are automatically included in the allergic drug category. In the digital drug order system, warning panels are activated when a drug with allergy information is prescribed (Fig.  Warning screen that appears when a drug with an allergy is entered in the digital order system. The allergenic food name of patients reporting food allergies is recorded in the system. The patient’s diet is recorded on the patient’s digital patient card at the first admission. If an allergic food is reported, a consultation is requested from the nutrition and dietetics department to create a special diet for the patient. During meal distribution, the meals are brought to the patient rooms by scanning the QR code-enabled wristbands. For example, a patient whose egg allergy information is entered is not given eggs or any foods containing eggs. We decided to conduct our study on patients hospitalized in a general surgery clinic, considering that treatments for surgical diseases are likely to outweigh other patient characteristics. We thought that we would provide a suitable study population due to the importance of both antibiotic prophylaxis or treatments and patient nutrition regimens in gastrointestinal surgeries in the treatment process. All patients hospitalized in the general surgery services of our hospital during a 1-year period throughout 2023 were retrospectively scanned from HIMS and patient files. During this period, patients who wore a red wristband and had allergy information in the HIMS digital patient card were included in the study. Patients with recurrent hospitalizations were included in the study as 1 patient. Patients with missing data were excluded from the study. Patients who were classified as allergic patients due to allergic asthma, seasonal allergy, pollen allergy, cosmetic product allergy, but did not have food or DA were identified. A preliminary analysis was conducted including the data of these patients in order to determine the rates of inappropriate allergy labeling. Then, the data of patients with inappropriate allergy labels were excluded from the study and the data of patients with drug and/or FA labels were analyzed. Age, gender, history of DA, active ingredient names in drug allergies, and allergenic food type in food allergies were recorded. Patients with drug and/or food allergies were called the “allergy label group” in the study, and the total number of patients hospitalized in the general surgery clinic during the study period was called the “study population.” SPSS 25.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago) analysis program was used for statistical evaluation of the data. Categorical measurements were summarized as numbers and percentages, and continuous measurements were summarized as mean and standard deviation (median and minimum–maximum where appropriate). The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to determine whether the parameters in the study showed normal distribution. The Local Ethics Committee for Clinical Research (Date: June 12, 2024, Decision No. 23) approval was obtained for our single-center and retrospective observational study. All procedures were performed in accordance with ethical rules and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients are required to sign informed consent forms for the procedures to be performed in the clinic during hospitalization. The data of a total of 5810 patients hospitalized in the general surgery clinic during a 1-year period were scanned and recurrent hospitalizations were recorded once. During the study period, data on 759 patients who used red wristbands and had an allergy warning in the digital patient record system were accessed. The rate of these patients in the entire sample was 13%. However, in the patient group with allergy warnings, allergy labels were also applied to patients who reported that they were allergic to cosmetic products, cleaning chemicals, house dust, pollen, and bee stings. Patients who wore red wristbands for reasons other than food or drug allergies constituted 35% of the patient group with allergy warnings. Demographic data for patients tagged with allergy warning systems are summarized in Table  Demographic data and distribution of subgroups for all allergy labels. min–max = minimum–maximum, SD = standard deviation. Data from 500 patients with drug and/or FA labels were reanalyzed. After this stage, the patient group with drug and/or FA labels (N = 500) was named as the “allergy label group” in the presentation of the analysis data. In addition, the group of all patients hospitalized in the general surgery service during the study period (N = 5810) was named “study population.” The rate of allergy label group in the study population was measured as 8.6%. Four hundred twenty (84%) patients with DA, 92 (18.4%) patients with FA and 12 (2.4%) patients with both drug and FA were identified. The rates of patients with drug, food and both allergy labels in the study population were 7.22%, 1.58%, and 0.20%, respectively. The number of women among patients reporting allergy history was clearly prominent. 339 (67.8%) of the patients in the allergy label group, 288 (68.57%) in the DA group, and 59 (64.10%) in the FA group were women. In the allergy label group, the mean age of the patients was 52.02 ± 15.93 (18–96) and the number of patients younger than 65 was 387 (77.4%). Age analysis of other subgroups is given in Table  Patient demographic data on drug and food labels. min–max = minimum–maximum, SD = standard deviation. Antibiotic allergy was detected in 221 patients, the rate of which was found to be 29.11% in the allergy label group, 52.61% in the DA group and 3.8% in the study population. Among the antibiotic allergies reported as active substance, the most common was penicillin allergy (N = 124) and the rates in the study population, allergy label group, DA group and antibiotic allergy group were determined as 2.13%, 24.8%, 29.52%, and 56.10%, respectively. Thirty-one patients who reported antibiotic allergy were recorded as having unknown antibiotic allergy because the active substance was unknown, and this group constituted 14% of antibiotic allergies, 7.38% of drug allergies, and 0.53% of the study population. The number of patients who reported multiple antibiotic allergies was 5 (1.19% of the DA group and 0.08% of the study population). The second most frequently detected subgroup among drug allergies was painkiller allergy. The rate of 112 patients in this subgroup was found to be 1.92% in the study population and 26.7% in the DA group. The 3 most frequently detected painkillers for which allergies were reported were NSAIDs, metamizole sodium and paracetamol. The rates in the painkiller allergy group were 52.7%, 21.4%, 19.6%, and the rates in the DA group were 14.04%, 5.71%, 5.23%, respectively. Allergy to contrast agents used for radiological imaging was detected in 13 patients. Contrast agent allergy constituted 0.22% of the study population and 3.1% of the DA group. In the digital system records, it was seen that a patient had an allergy to the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent gadolinium. However, during the patient’s hospitalization, an anaphylactic reaction developed during the computed tomography (CT) scan performed with the contrast agent and the patient was intubated and monitored in the intensive care unit. Therefore, both contrast agents are recorded on the allergy label. This patient died during the intensive care unit follow-up. The distribution of patients with DA labels according to subgroups is given in Table  Distribution of drug allergy labels by subgroups. MRI = magnetic resonance imaging, NSAIDs = nonsteroidal anti inflamatuar drugs, PPI = proton pump inhibitor.  The most common allergens among the active ingredients are listed. Ninety-two patients with FA labels were identified. These constituted 1.58% of the study population and 12.2% of the allergy label group. The most frequently recorded allergenic foods were tomatoes, mushrooms, spice products, eggs, milk and dairy products. Twelve patients in the allergy label group had both drug and food allergies, the rate in the study population being 0.20%. Five patients with mushroom allergy were also found to have penicillin allergy. Data for patients with other drug and food allergies are given in Table  Analysis of food allergy labels by food type. Only one patient died during the study period from anaphylactic shock caused by a substance other than that listed on the allergy label. No other patients with an allergy label experienced any adverse events due to allergic reactions. Our study presents the results of a detailed analysis of both food and DA rates in our high-volume general surgery clinic. In the literature, the number of publications addressing food and drug allergies together is quite limited. Although the number of patients with both food and DA labels is low, the high rate of co-occurrence of edible mushrooms and penicillin DA is striking. We could not find any data in the literature that could explain whether this situation is important or not. Even in a detailed study that shows that edible mushrooms cause food allergies and different allergic reactions and conveys the immunological stages of these allergic mechanisms, we could not see any information about the direct relationship between mushroom and penicillin DA. As in our study, individual drug allergens are reported to be significantly more prevalent in female patients in many studies. In addition, a history of DA has been reported more frequently in elderly patients due to the burden caused by polypharmacy. Studies have shown that surgical site infections have increased due to the decrease in the use of cefazolin for perioperative prophylaxis and the prescription of alternative antibiotics to β-lactams. Patients with reported penicillin allergy are often treated with alternative antibiotics that are broader in spectrum, more toxic, and more expensive. One study found a 69% increase in the risk of methicillin-resistant  After antibiotics, painkillers are the most common cause of drug allergies. Among painkillers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most commonly reported subgroup as shown in many studies. Paracetamol and opioids are among the other most common painkiller allergies. In a study of 2431 unique patients, NSAID allergy was reported in 20.7% and paracetamol allergy in 5.3%. Reports of allergy to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), one of the most commonly used drug groups for both treatment and prophylaxis, are becoming increasingly common. In a study, lansoprazole was reported to be the most common and rabeprazole was reported to be the subgroup with the least allergy history in the PPI group. In the past, radiologic contrast media were one of the most frequently reported groups of allergic reactions. With the introduction of nonionic, low-osmolar agents, allergic reactions to these agents have declined from 12% to 0.04%. Reactions to gadolinium used in MRI scans are much lower than reactions to radiologic contrast medias used in CT scans. Although reports of allergic reactions to these agents have decreased, drug reactions leading to fatal anaphylaxis can be observed. Fatal anaphylaxis due to allergies is fortunately quite rare. In a comprehensive study, it was emphasized that mortality for drug-induced anaphylaxis was estimated to be 0.05 to 0.51 per million people and 0.03 to 0.32 for food-induced anaphylaxis. It was reported that peanuts or tree nuts account for half of deaths from food-induced anaphylaxis. One of the biggest challenges with allergy labeling is that some of the symptoms that patients describe as allergies may not actually be allergy symptoms. The patients with allergy labels for reasons other than food or DA accounted for 35% of the entire allergy label group. Thomas et al reported that red wristbands were used to indicate the presence of allergy in 112 (52.6%) of 213 centers in their prospective multicenter study. Our study had some limitations due to its retrospective nature and the inclusion of patients admitted to only one clinic in a single-center. The main limitations were the lack of any confirmation test for allergies in patients with allergy labels and the lack of an institutional protocol for these patients. In addition, the lack of records of allergic reactions encountered in inpatients and the fact that it was not known whether any tests were performed for allergies after discharge were also weaknesses of our study. Despite all these, we find it valuable to thoroughly detail the rates of both drug and food allergies among all patients admitted to general surgery services within the 1-year period of our study. We believe that the results of this study will serve as a guide for changing the traditional practices of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in patients labeled with allergies. Additionally, we hope that the allergenic food sub-analysis related to food allergies in our study will encourage the use of personalized dietary treatments. Accurately inquiring about the allergy histories of hospitalized patients and labeling those with allergies is crucial for preventing potential adverse allergic reactions. Patients’ allergy statuses should be communicated through both identifying wristbands, such as red wristbands, and alert systems on digital patient records. We believe that educational programs should be implemented to increase the knowledge levels of both patients and healthcare professionals regarding allergy labels and that protocols related to allergy labeling should be developed in healthcare facilities.', 'PubMed_Central', 'asthma_treatment', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/', 'research_article', '{"content_hash": "6f0557bc4ffc804c", "embedding_date": "2025-06-25T14:21:35.717941", "scraper_source": "PubMed_Central", "category": "research_literature", "subcategory": "pubmed_central", "document_type": "research_article", "published_date": "", "original_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/"}', 19850);

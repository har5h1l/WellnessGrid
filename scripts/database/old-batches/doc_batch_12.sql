VALUES ('CGRP-Targeted Migraine Therapies in Patients With Vascular Risk Factors or Stroke', 'Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)–targeted therapies, including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and gepants, represent a major advancement in migraine prevention, offering greater efficacy and improved tolerability compared with traditional treatments. These agents selectively inhibit the CGRP pathway, a key mediator in migraine pathophysiology, and are increasingly used even as first-line options in selected patients. While clinical trials and real-world data suggest a favorable cardiovascular (CV) safety profile, particularly in patients without major risk factors, evidence remains limited for those with established vascular disease or recent vascular events. Concerns persist regarding long-term effects and the safety of CGRP blockade in high-risk populations. This narrative review focuses on the CV and cerebrovascular safety of CGRP-targeted migraine treatments—an area of growing clinical relevance. We compare these newer agents with traditional migraine preventives and highlight the paucity of data in patients with previous stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, or significant CV comorbidities. In addition, we discuss the emerging topic of dual CGRP pathway blockade (mAbs plus gepants), which has not previously been reviewed in the context of vascular risk. Based on currently available scientific evidence, we offer structured clinical considerations to guide the use of CGRP-targeted therapies in patients with vascular risk or cerebrovascular disease. Our aim is to support informed decision making in a population that has often been excluded from clinical trials but is becoming increasingly important in clinical practice. Migraine is the second most prevalent debilitating disorder among young individuals. Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide and the leading cause of long-term disability. Approximately two-thirds of all strokes are ischemic, and one-third is hemorrhagic. Shared Risk Factors of Stroke and Migraine Abbreviations: CRP = C-reactive protein; CSD = cortical spreading depression; IL = interleukin; PFO = patent foramen ovale. A comprehensive search was conducted on MEDLINE using the terms “stroke,” “CGRP,” “gepants,” and “monoclonal antibodies,” combined with the linking word “AND.” Abstracts were then screened for relevance to the topic, and full-text articles were reviewed to extract relevant information and for relevant references. All recommendations in the discussion are the consensus of the authors, based on current evidence. Currently, 2 types of CGRP pathway–targeting medications are available: monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and gepants. For episodic and chronic migraine treatment, 4 mAbs are approved: eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab. The migraine preventive effect of erenumab is caused by the mAb''s binding affinity to the extracellular canonical CGRP receptor, whereas eptinezumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab bind to the endogenous CGRP ligand, respectively. Given their half-life of approximately 28–32 days, the administration of erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab requires a monthly subcutaneous application. By contrast, eptinezumab is administered IV at 3-month intervals, and for high-dose fremanezumab, every 3-month subcutaneous application is possible. The orally or nasally administered gepants directly interact with the CGRP receptor by binding one of the subunits of the canonical CGRP receptor. In comparison with mAbs, gepants show a by far shorter half-life (from 5 to 11 hours) and can be used for acute migraine treatment and/or preventative migraine treatment. Atogepant and rimegepant are approved for preventive migraine treatment. Notably, rimegepant can be used as acute migraine and preventive migraine medication. Rimegepant for preventive use is taken every other day while atogepant is taken daily. Ubrogepant and rimegepant for acute migraine use should be taken similar to triptans. Zavegepant is the first gepant that is applied nasally for acute migraine attack termination. In healthy participants, mAbs cannot penetrate the BBB to a relevant amount, which is due to their high molecular weight. In summary, CGRP-targeting migraine therapies have been demonstrated to exhibit a significantly reduced side-effect profile and higher efficacy in reducing MHDs in comparison with conventional migraine preventatives. This assertion is substantiated by the findings of the randomized, double-blind HERMES trial, which conducted a comparative analysis between erenumab and topiramate. They also have a much favorable benefit-risk ratio, especially in the largest migraine patient group: young women of childbearing age. The use of mAbs and gepants targeting the CGRP system has proven to be an effective, safe, and well-tolerated approach for reducing migraine attacks. Recent studies have extended follow-up periods beyond 2 years and included patients with CV risk factors. For example, an analysis of AEs associated with erenumab showed low incidences of ischemic CV and cerebrovascular events, with similar rates across different 10-year CV risk categories. A recent study In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 88 participants with stable angina received either an IV infusion of erenumab (140 mg) or placebo, followed by an exercise treadmill test. An observational cohort study assessed the CV safety of erenumab and fremanezumab over at least 1 year. In Europe, the EudraVigilance database confirmed that CV adverse drug reactions linked to anti-CGRP therapies align with existing literature. Because gepants represent the latest approved targeted migraine therapies, study data beyond comprehensive approval studies are scarce. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study with 22 healthy male volunteers, no vasoconstrictive effect of telcagepant was identified, when the participants were orally administered 500 mg of telcagepant (representing the second highest dose of telcagepant studied in RCTs) or placebo. In phase 3 trials for atogepant, rimegepant, and ubrogepant, no increase in CV AEs among treated patients have been reported. Selected Meta-Analyses and Clinical and Preclinical Trials Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Monoclonal Antibodies and Gepants in Migraine Treatment Abbreviations: AE = adverse event; CV = cardiovascular; CVD = cardiovascular disease; FMD = flow-mediated dilation; mAb = monoclonal antibody; RCT = randomized controlled trial; VMR = vasomotor reactivity. A case report describes a 41-year-old woman with episodic migraine without aura who received preventive mAb therapy with erenumab 70 mg. Two case reports have described reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) in women who were undergoing preventive therapy with fremanezumab The results of the large RCTs, which enrolled more than 10,000 patients with migraine, did not indicate any relevant increase in CV risk in patients who received mAbs or gepants. This is a significant finding, given that RCTs represent the highest level of evidence in medicine. In addition, the combination of CGRP-targeting therapies with potentially vasoconstrictive triptans or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is safe in RCTs and in real-world data. However, preclinical studies have indicated an elevated risk for individuals under CGRP-targeted therapies and acute vascular events, such as stroke, at least in animal models. Because these treatments have been emerging over the past 5 years and might become the first-line treatment in patients with migraine, careful evaluation of CV safety in patients need to be studied further. The 3 case reports described above do not prove direct causality between stroke or RCVS and CGRP-interfering treatment. However, it is crucial to consider the implications for patients using these migraine preventive therapies in acute stroke settings. It has been proposed that CGRP blockage may affect cerebral hemodynamics in clinical responders to mAb preventive treatment, with lower cerebral blood-flow velocity (a marker for decreased CBF) observed in this subgroup. This leads us to consider how we might best approach the treatment of stroke patients who are currently receiving CGRP-targeted therapies. It seems prudent to suggest that treatment with CGRP pathway mAbs or gepants should be paused immediately. After (ischemic) stroke, the reintroduction of CGRP pathway–targeted therapies may be reconsidered after a thorough evaluation of the potential benefits and harms in each individual patient. Establishing a precise time frame for discontinuing CGRP pathway–targeting drugs after stroke is challenging because poststroke remodeling is an individual and dynamic process. Motor recovery after stroke typically occurs within the first 3 months, whereas other remodeling processes can last up to 1 year. Based on existing data, it can be assumed that patients aged 65 years or younger without relevant CVD will not exhibit an increased risk of stroke due to CGRP-interfering drugs per se. This assumption is based on > 10,000 patients in phase 1–3 RCTs, postmarketing studies, long-term observational studies, and large migraine registries. However, as society in industrialized countries ages, an increasing number of people with migraine will face CVD. Various tools, such as the atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) score, have been developed to estimate a patient''s risk of experiencing a CV event within the next 10 years. This score considers factors such as age; sex; ethnicity; cholesterol levels; blood pressure; smoking status; diabetes mellitus; and current use of hypertension, statin, and aspirin therapies. Despite these variables, determining whether a patient can safely undergo CGRP-targeted therapy cannot be conclusively answered based on the ASCVD score alone. The (patho)physiology of CGRP is complex, presenting a challenging decision-making process. Nonetheless, we agree that there are certain groups of patients who should avoid CGRP-targeted therapies, including those with small vessel disease, distal artery stenosis, and uncontrolled hypertension and patients having RP. Clinical Guidance Suggested in Patients With Acute and Postacute Stroke and Patients Facing Stroke Risk Abbreviations: ASCVD = atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; CGRP = calcitonin gene-related peptide; CV = cardiovascular; CVD = cardiovascular disease; mAb = monoclonal antibody; NSAID = nonsteroidal inflammatory drug; RCT = randomized controlled trial; RP = Raynaud phenomenon; SAH = subarachnoid hemorrhage. It would be beneficial for future investigations to comprise animal and human data on a multidisciplinary level to gain a deeper understanding of the safe use of CGRP-targeting therapies. It is also important to recognize the vital role that neurologists play in diagnosing and treating migraine patients effectively over time. Although evidence about a dual blockade of the CGRP pathway with mAbs for preventive treatment and gepants for acute migraine treatment is scarce, increasing numbers of people with migraine have been using this kind of therapy. Because dual CGRP blockade represents the latest possibility in migraine prevention and acute treatment, only a handful of studies exist evaluating the efficacy and safety of this combination. Erenumab or galcanezumab for preventive use and ubrogepant for acute use were evaluated in an open-label label study with a follow-up of 45 days with no reported CV concerns. In summary, CGRP has been found to play a profound role in migraine pathogenesis but also covers beneficial tissue-protecting roles in CVD, especially in stroke. Current data of large RCTs do not suggest any elevation in stroke risk per se; however, data of people with preexisting CVD receiving CGRP-targeted treatment are scarce. As mAb preventive migraine treatment might become first-line treatment, evidence-based data of older patients (≥65 years) and people facing comorbidities need to be established. Based on current data, we suggest the following approach for 3 different scenarios: In patients with acute stroke or SAH, all CGRP-targeted treatments should be paused immediately. Reinitiation of CGRP-targeted treatment needs to be evaluated particularly by the patients'' stroke etiology and other CV comorbidities. A treatment pause of a minimum of 3 months needs to be respected, and patients with small vessel disease should not undergo CGRP-targeted treatment. In older patients with preexisting CV comorbidities, traditional migraine preventives (e.g., beta-blockers) should be preferred. If CGRP-targeted treatment is still considered, gepants should be preferred because of their shorter half-life. mAbs or gepants should not be used in patients with small vessel disease or RP at all.', 'PubMed_Central', 'exercise_medicine', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/', 'research_article', '{"content_hash": "142ad486ec2d0c13", "embedding_date": "2025-06-25T14:21:20.968485", "scraper_source": "PubMed_Central", "category": "research_literature", "subcategory": "pubmed_central", "document_type": "research_article", "published_date": "", "original_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/"}', 12786);

VALUES ('A feasibility study on non-invasive and non-contact jugular venous pulse measurement using 60 GHz FMCW radar', 'The jugular venous pulse (JVP) reflects right atrial pressure and provides diagnostic insight into cardiovascular and pulmonary health. However, reliable assessment remains difficult due to neck adiposity, anatomical variability and suboptimal positioning. Although central venous catheterization is the gold standard, its invasive nature restricts routine or long-term use. This study introduces a non-invasive method for JVP estimation using a 60 GHz frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar. The system captures venous pulsations at the skin surface and applies eigenbeamforming to enhance signal-to-noise ratio and pulse clarity. Radar parameters were optimized for signal fidelity and validated through morphological comparison with simultaneously recorded photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. Additionally, we compared radar-derived JVP signals with previously recorded catheterization data from a patient with early-stage heart failure to assess clinical relevance. Signal localization was successfully achieved within a direction-of-arrival (DoA) range of  Heart failure (HF) occurs when the heart is unable to pump the required amount of blood adequately to meet the demands of the entire body. This condition can arise because of either the heart’s inability to fill with an adequate blood volume or a weakened capacity to pump effectively. HF can potentially impair the functionality of vital organs, such as the brain, liver and kidneys. In Australia, approximately 15% of hospitalizations have been attributed to HF [ HF, also known as congestive heart failure (CHF), results in impaired blood pumping and venous congestion due to blood backing up into systemic and pulmonary veins. Right-sided HF is particularly associated with elevated venous pressure and gradual symptom onset, emphasizing the importance of right ventricular assessment. The jugular venous pulse (JVP) serves as a key indicator, offering insights into venous pressure and right heart abnormalities such as atrial fibrillation or tricuspid valve disorders [ As shown in  ( Traditional JVP estimation is invasive and limited mainly to critically ill patients in intensive or coronary care settings because of the high risk of complications. Traditionally, the IJV has been preferred for JVP assessment due to concerns that valves in the EJV may interfere with accurate measurements. However, this view is outdated. The IJV also contains valves that do not hinder pressure evaluation and may even enhance the visibility of venous waveforms by amplifying atrial pulsations, as noted by Steven McGee [ Non-invasive approaches for JVP estimation have explored PPG, though its reliability is often hindered by sensitivity to skin and tissue properties, which complicates calibration [ This study, for the first time, employs a 60 GHz frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar for non-contact JVP assessment. The higher operating frequency provides enhanced spatial resolution and sensitivity to subtle surface displacements. The Infineon BGT60TR13C radar module was selected for its integrated antenna-in-package design, reduced interference susceptibility, and flexible parameter configuration. Furthermore, this work is the first to utilize the Sim4Life platform from ZMT Zurich MedTech AG to investigate the impact of RF electromagnetic fields on the neck region, specifically in the context of high-frequency radar for JVP monitoring. The key innovation lies in combining 60 GHz FMCW radar sensing with electromagnetic simulations to assess specific absorption rate (SAR) and power density (PD), supporting a safe and clinically applicable method for non-invasive JVP monitoring via the EJV. The most common and widely available method for measuring JVP is cannulation, an invasive technique considered the gold standard. In this procedure, an experienced anaesthesiologist inserts venous catheters into the right internal jugular or subclavian vein (SVC). These catheters are then connected to a multi-modular monitor via a pressure transducer. After zeroing the transducer to the heart level, the mean venous pressure (mm Hg) is displayed in real-time on the monitor and recorded as invasive venous pressure [ Invasive methods can lead to various complications related to vascular access and typically require trained and skilled physicians. Non-invasive techniques for JVP assessment are broadly categorized into intermittent and continuous methods. Continuous monitoring is particularly valuable for remote cardiac care. Several recent approaches employ pressure sensors, ultrasound, PPG and accelerometry. Ultrasound imaging of the IJV is the most established method, offering real-time clinical insights [ To address these limitations, García-López  Other modalities include accelerometer-based sensing, which captures skin vibrations linked to jugular and carotid flow [ In the broader context of PPG-based cardiovascular assessment, Elgendi  Non-invasive monitoring of the JVP has advanced through various contactless techniques. Amelard  Further innovations include Tang  Microwave radar technologies have also been explored. A prototype utilizing 24 GHz radar demonstrated the feasibility of JVP measurement; however, challenges in qualitative pulse interpretation persist [ FMCW radar systems, at higher frequencies, have emerged as a viable solution for non-contact JVP monitoring. These systems can detect minute surface motions associated with cardiac activity, offering high-resolution data without direct skin contact [ The adoption of FMCW radar technology holds promise for remote and continuous monitoring of heart failure patients, potentially reducing the need for frequent hospital visits and enabling timely clinical interventions. This study aims to validate the efficacy of a 60 GHz FMCW radar system for non-invasive JVP assessment, evaluating its performance through experimental data and exploring its potential for broader clinical application. This study utilizes a commercially available 60 GHz FMCW radar sensor (BGT60TR13C, Infineon Technologies AG) as shown in  ( To assess electromagnetic interactions and safety, we employed the Sim4Life simulation platform (ZMT Zurich MedTech AG) [ Optimal radar placement is essential to ensure signal strength without saturation or loss of detail due to distance. To maximize physiological signal detection, we first identified the most suitable neck location for targeting the jugular vein. Given that venous return and pressure dynamics are influenced by gravity, the jugular pulse is best observed at a reclined angle between 30° and 45°. To guide positioning, we referred to small intestine (SI) acupuncture points SI16 and SI17, as shown in  To validate system sensitivity, we simulated JVP-like movement using a speaker plate facing the radar and emitting a synthetic beat signal composed of two frequencies ( As shown in  A speaker plate, positioned to face the radar, simulates a patient target in this experimental set-up. The experiment involves the synthesis of an audio signal, meticulously composed of two specific frequencies, 50 Hz and 54 Hz, to evaluate the radar system''s response. This integrated material and system design approach enables both safety validation and signal fidelity assessment, laying the foundation for reliable non-contact JVP monitoring using high-frequency radar. The workflow for the detection of the JVP is described in this section. The data cube contains the normalized ADC samples of the received signal. Each frame of data consists of the number of receiving antennas ( Flowchart of the data processing sequence. After reshaping the raw data, an FFT is performed on the samples to obtain the range information. Upon computation of FFT, displacement is calculated from the phase variation, which is then used to extract the JVP. Below, we detail each step in the signal processing sequence, accompanied by the corresponding pseudo-codes. The raw data vector is first reshaped into a matrix. FFT processing was applied to every chirp pulse in each frame and to each antenna. (The optional windowing technique can be used before the FFT for spectrum interpolation.) The FFT outputs are averaged to reduce the noise effect for each antenna signal and from each frame. From the averaged spectrum of the raw data, each antenna detected the first spike as a radar echo from the patient’s skin. The inverse fourier transform (IFFT) of first spectrum bin to extract IQ complex signal for each antenna. The FFT is performed separately for the best two antennas (1 and 3) in terms of their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Additionally, the averaging process is crucial here for noise reduction and signal clarity enhancement. While the I/Q extraction process follows the approach in [ Eigen-beamforming is widely used in radar and communication systems for directionally selective reception [ Selecting this modified version of beamforming is due to one bin selection from the FFT-range function, which induces pure sine wave function as an I/Q signal. In such one bin output signal, very low noise contribution is observed in the IQ signal, which implies an almost noise-free observation vector  is by definition a rank-one matrix, and with almost noise-free observation, this covariance matrix is ill-conditioned (the ratio of the highest eigenvalue to the smallest eigenvalue is much greater than 1) and hence non-invertible. Constructing the steering vector (vector of signal phases in each receiving antenna) for a given direction of Arrival  The received signal power at the output of the beamformer is calculated with respect to the angle  such that: This last expression is a  To address the noisy circular pattern in the I/Q plane, Taubin circular regression with a singular value decomposition (SVD) based implementation was employed to correct offset and noise. See electronic supplementary material, figure S6 in section S6. This method was selected for its robustness and reduced algebraic error, offering greater accuracy than traditional least squares approaches [ To extract the phase variation of reflected radar echoes caused by skin displacement, we extract the first instantaneous phase of the output signal from our eigen-beamformer. This instantaneous phase must be unwrapped to retrieve its linearly growing nature over time. Only phase fast variation, rather than linear behaviour of the instantaneous phase, carries information about the jugular pulse. To extract these variations, we use phase differences between successive phase samples. Skin displacement is related to phase variation using wave number  Studies have reported that the visibility of most of the JVP components falls below 4 Hz [ In this section, we present a detailed discussion of the simulation outcomes along with the data analysis results. The data analysis section covered both time and frequency domain analyses at various inclinations, along with a comparison between the JVP and the PPG signal. Additionally, we compared the spectrum of the non-invasive JVP measurements with data obtained from the right heart catheterization (RHC) method. The SAR and PD reduce with the increase in distance for high frequencies. In the design operation of our device, we have carefully maintained a 2 mm distance between the radar and the skin surface. This specific distance has been chosen to ensure that the SAR and PD values are kept within safe and acceptable limits [ For our experiment, the selection of antennas was guided by the SNR criterion. This SNR metric, which correlates to the amount of reflected energy captured, is influenced by the positioning of the antennas relative to the vein. The optimal antenna configuration is the one that positions the vein equidistantly between the selected pair of antennas. From the FFT analysis, the first FFT-range bin was chosen as the logical reference point, corresponding to the initial radar reflection from the closest obstacle, typically the skin. The other reflections (i.e. bins) relate to the other obstacles present in the environment. For reference, see electronic supplementary material, figure S8 in section S6. Our study explores a proof-of-concept technology for JVP detection using varying radar parameters, such as samples/chirp, chirps/frame and sampling frequency. Our findings, illustrated in  Detected JVP waveforms (red) overlaid on the full signal (blue); inset zooms into a JVP waveform marked by points indicating the ascent and descent of the waveform, respectively. The quality of the JVP signal changes with the body’s inclination, and this phenomenon is physiological. In a healthy person, the visible jugular veins are fully collapsed when standing and are often distended to a variable degree when the person is supine. Selecting an appropriate intermediate position permits the top of the column to become visible in the neck between the clavicle and the mandible. So, as the angle increases, the carotid pulse is expected to be more dominant compared with JVP, overshadowing its features. Analyses of JVP signal at both time ( Comparison of JVP and PPG signals from synchronized measurements, highlighting temporal alignment and amplitude differences between JVP and PPG pulsations. As a proof-of-concept feasibility study, the experiment was ethically limited to a healthy subject. While cardiac catheterization remains the gold standard for JVP assessment, it is invasive and typically reserved for critically ill patients. To provide comparative insight, we analysed RHC data from a patient with TR—an early marker of CHF, and compared its spectral characteristics with the JVP signal from our healthy subject. This comparison highlights waveform differences between normal and early-stage CHF conditions. In  Frequency spectrum comparison of RHC CVP signal and sensor recorded JVP signal. Both spectra are shown in normalized amplitude (dB) over a frequency range, emphasizing the frequency components and amplitudes that are characteristic of cardiovascular waveforms. Of note, CVP is an invasive measure, and JVP is a non-invasive measure that reflects the right atrial pressure. Due to the non-invasive nature, there will be timing delays and attenuation because of the distance between the jugular vein and the right atrium. Also, JVP can be influenced by factors like the patient’s position, neck angle and even breathing pattern, which might not directly affect CVP. Nonetheless, the correlation between them confirms that JVP can serve as a useful non-invasive estimate for understanding right heart health. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using a 60 GHz FMCW radar for non-invasive JVP extraction. The radar’s high resolution, integrated antenna design and sensitivity to subtle skin displacements make it well-suited for detecting venous pulsations. All recordings utilized the maximum bandwidth of 5.5 GHz in close-range measurements. JVP signal quality was found to depend on radar–subject distance. Too close a placement caused overlap between the initial reflection and the DC component in the FFT spectrum, while excessive distance diminished signal amplitude. An optimal spacing of approximately 2 mm was maintained. Additionally, inter-bin mixing effects and hardware constraints—particularly the tight coupling between sampling frequency and chirp configuration—necessitated precise tuning of system parameters. At least eight chirps were required to reliably extract phase information due to the radar’s fast chirp generation characteristics. These findings highlight the potential of high-frequency radar for integration into non-contact clinical monitoring systems, offering a promising alternative to invasive techniques for early cardiovascular assessment. Through meticulous evaluation, we established the subsequent configuration for JVP estimation with this radar: Higher sampling rate for a fast time (higher number of samples per chirp) to increase FFT-range resolution. Because a lower value implies a reduction of the signal quality and even burying the signal in noise. Suppress averaging on FFT-range spectrums over all chirps to avoid losing JVP signal details. Higher frame rate to get more time resolution for JVP signal. In some situations, a signal with low SNR in one antenna can significantly reduce the performance of the beamformer and, eventually, the pulse detection. Therefore, an antenna selection procedure must be adopted. Also, a shorter chirp duration is helpful because if the chirp is longer, the chirp reflection collides with the transmitted one. Therefore, for better results, we narrowed down the parameter values in  Radar configuration for optimal JVP estimation. parameter value/condition number of samples per chirp 128 or the highest possible value frame rate 250 Hz or the closest possible value number of chirps per frame chirp duration 0.00013 s or closest possible value The receiver chip employs only an in-phase (I) mixer, producing a real-valued intermediate frequency (IF) signal without a quadrature (Q) component. Applying a Fourier transform yields complex I/Q data, enabling phase analysis across frequencies. However, this architecture is susceptible to signal fading caused by phase offsets between the reference and reflected signals, limiting its temporal accuracy compared with true I/Q radar systems. Through the configuration illustrated in  The original beat signal exhibits a pronounced spike thanks to its high amplitude. By contrast, radar-based beat reconstruction reveals an inconsistent envelope signal stemming from the phase difference between the received signal and the local oscillator. This experiment not only confirms the effectiveness of our algorithm but also sheds light on the constraints related to the hardware (see electronic supplementary material S6, figure S9). Therefore, we prefer to use a sensor equipped with an IQ mixer for future experiments. JVP signals are often obscured by dominant arterial or respiratory components, complicating their isolation and analysis. While Suzuki  While this work provides insight into the feasibility of a contactless and non-invasive JVP measurement, there are some potential challenges and limitations to consider. This proof-of-concept study needs to follow the usual clinical validation pathway for medical devices and technology, in which a control and target cohort will be recruited and studied against the gold standard (baseline). Our ongoing efforts aim to clinically gather evidence of the system’s efficacy with target and control cohorts of participants within a clinical setting through extensive analysis and validation. This study occurs before a proper clinical trial, which can be relatively quick due to this technology’s potentially favourable regulatory classification because of its non-invasive, contactless and low-risk features. It is also required to enhance the radar system’s signal-to-noise performance and explore the integration of automated signal-processing techniques. Also, we plan to incorporate wavelet-based techniques [ This study demonstrates the feasibility of using a 60 GHz FMCW radar for non-invasive JVP estimation, offering a compact and cost-effective alternative to conventional methods. We conducted simulation analyses across multiple frequencies and identified 60 GHz as the most suitable choice for this study. Despite hardware constraints, we successfully identified key signal parameters and validated radar-derived JVP signals through comparison with finger PPG data. A spectral comparison between the estimated JVP signal and catheter-acquired CVP data has also been presented. We also examined the influence of body posture and anatomical variability on signal quality. These findings highlight the radar’s clinical potential, particularly for early heart failure detection in remote settings. Future work will focus on larger cohorts and refining accuracy across diverse physiological conditions.', 'PubMed_Central', 'exercise_medicine', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/', 'research_article', '{"content_hash": "e4306a91c4f23fc9", "embedding_date": "2025-06-25T14:21:22.129436", "scraper_source": "PubMed_Central", "category": "research_literature", "subcategory": "pubmed_central", "document_type": "research_article", "published_date": "", "original_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/"}', 19985);

VALUES ('Laparoscopic treatment of giant ovarian cystic tumors in children: Case report', 'Ovarian cystic tumors are common in adult women. However, cases of ovarian cystic tumors approximately 30 cm in diameter are rarely reported in adult women and even rarer in children. Here, we report a rare case of a giant ovarian cystic tumor in a 13-year-old girl. A 13-year-old girl was admitted to hospital with abdominal pain and distension for 7 days. The parents felt anxious about the child’s abdominal lesions and requested laparoscopic surgery. After evaluation at our hospital, abdominal color ultrasound and enhanced computer tomography revealed a large sac-like fluid density shadow with clear edges in the abdomen, approximately 38 cm × 35 cm × 24 cm in size. We performed a laparoscopic resection of the cystic ovarian tumor, which was pathologically confirmed as a benign ovarian tumor. Subsequently, laparoscopic exploration revealed a huge cystic tumor originated from the right ovary with a clear boundary between the tumor and the right ovary. Laparoscopic surgery was used to remove the lesion, and the postoperative recovery and follow-up were uneventful. Cases of ovarian cystic tumors with a diameter of approximately 30 cm are very rare in pediatric patients. Laparoscopic surgery is an essential method for the diagnosis and treatment of giant ovarian cystic tumors and can be used as a first-line treatment. Ovarian cysts are approximately 14% more common in women of reproductive age The patient weighed 124 kg and was 153 cm tall.

Figure (B) represents the disappearance of abdominal distension postoperatively, with the triangle representing the head. Figure (C) shows the incision appearance postoperatively, with the triangle representing the head. (A and B) Abdominal enhanced CT showing large abdominal tumors with triangles. Figure (C) is the sac fluid extracted from the giant ovarian cystic tumor intraoperatively. CT = computer tomography. Based on history, physical examination, imaging, and laboratory examination, the possibility of ovarian cystic tumor was considered. Due to the large size of the tumor and its mainly cystic component, we decided to conduct a laparoscopic surgical exploration. Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in a supine position. A 10 mm incision was made at the lower umbilical margin, and the incision was made into the abdomen by layer. A puncture needle was placed under direct vision to extract the fluid in the cystic tumor slowly, and approximately 13,000 mL was extracted (Fig.  (A) The triangle is the giant cystic tumor of the right ovary specimen, and the arrow is the cyst of the left ovary specimen. Figure (B) shows HE staining of the follicular cyst the right ovarian tumor, with pathological images of ×100, most of the lining epithelial cells of the cyst wall were shed, and the fibrous tissue of the cyst wall was hyperplastic.

HE = hematoxylin and eosin. Figure  The nursing roadmap in this paper is shown in Figure  Nursing roadmap. CT = computer tomography. Among ovarian cysts, giant ovarian cysts in children are rare. The specific cause of ovarian cysts is unclear; however, it is believed to be related to environment, diet, endocrine, heredity, and so on. Ovarian cysts can be divided into functional, neoplastic, endometritic, and tubal. Functional cysts are relatively rare in children, mainly luteal and follicular cysts, and most resolve spontaneously under observation or drug intervention. Ovarian cysts have no specific symptoms. A few are found due to torsion, rupture, and acute abdomen, most are inadvertently found during physical examination. Mesenteric and retroperitoneal cystic tumors should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of large cystic tumors in the abdominal cavity of children. Ovarian cyst treatment can be divided into conservative and surgical treatments. Most ovarian cysts are treated conservatively with observation. Ovarian cysts: commonly have a diameter >5 cm, tend to be malignant, and ovarian cyst torsion and other symptoms require surgical treatment. Cases of giant ovarian cystic tumors approximately 30 cm in diameter in children are rare. Complete laparoscopic resection of the tumor was successful. The patient recovered smoothly after surgery, and no recurrence was observed during 1-year follow-up. We hope our report provides clinicians with ideas for diagnosis and treatment to provide better medical care to children.

VALUES ('Molecular insights into gender-specific differences in rheumatoid arthritis: A study using high-throughput sequencing and Mendelian randomization', 'Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multifaceted autoimmune disorder with notable gender differences. The impact of gender-specific genetic variations on RA’s pathogenesis remains unclear. This research investigates gender-specific genes in RA using Mendelian randomization (MR) and transcriptome sequencing to understand RA mechanisms, focusing on gender-specific immune responses. We used the limma package to analyze gender-differential genes in RA patients, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses. Key genes were identified through least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and support vector machine recursive feature elimination, and a diagnostic nomogram was constructed and validated using the gene expression omnibus database. Immune cell and function analyses were performed using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis, and a competing endogenous ribonucleic acid (RNA) network was constructed. MR analysis was used to investigate the causal relationship between gender-differential genes and RA. Thirty differentially expressed genes were identified, with Gene Ontology analysis indicating their involvement in neutrophil-mediated killing. Six key genes (MAP7D2, AR, DNAH6, CXorf36, ORM1, and IQGAP3) were identified, and a diagnostic nomogram was developed (area under the curve: 0.956 in the training set, 0.859 in the validation set  Gender-specific differences in RA: The study identifies significant gender-specific genetic variations in rheumatoid arthritis, with a focus on how these differences influence immune responses. Key gene identification and diagnostic tool: Six key genes (MAP7D2, AR, DNAH6, CXorf36, ORM1, and IQGAP3) were identified as crucial, leading to the development and validation of a diagnostic nomogram with high accuracy. Immune cell analysis: Female RA patients were found to have lower levels of macrophages and neutrophils, highlighting gender-based differences in immune cell function. Mendelian randomization insights: The study used MR analysis to uncover the specific role of the RETN gene in seronegative RA patients, particularly in females. Clinical implications: The findings provide a foundation for developing personalized treatment strategies tailored to the gender-specific mechanisms of RA. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by persistent joint inflammation, leading to pain, functional disability, and systemic complications such as cardiovascular disease, pulmonary fibrosis, and osteoporosis. These manifestations significantly impair patients’ quality of life and survival, with China facing a substantial disease burden of approximately 5 million cases. A striking feature of RA is its pronounced gender disparity: women exhibit a threefold higher incidence than men and often experience more aggressive disease progression. This discrepancy strongly implicates sex-specific biological mechanisms in RA pathogenesis. Recent advances highlight multifaceted interactions between sex hormones, genetic susceptibility, and immune regulation. Estrogen has been shown to amplify Th17-mediated pro-inflammatory responses via ER-α signaling, while androgens like testosterone suppress autoantibody production by promoting Treg differentiation. Current therapies, including conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologics, have improved symptom control but remain limited by variable efficacy, adverse effects (e.g., hepatotoxicity, infections), and a lack of gender-specific treatment guidelines. To bridge this gap, Mendelian randomization (MR) offers a promising solution. As a genetic epidemiology method, MR uses genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) to infer causal relationships, minimizing confounding and reverse causality. In addition, the heterogeneity in clinical outcomes, adverse events, and drug responses between male and female RA patients further underscores the need for sex-aware research strategies. Therefore, this study seeks to systematically explore the sex-specific molecular mechanisms of RA by integrating MR and transcriptomics. We aim to identify RA-related genetic variants with sex-differential effects, detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between male and female patients and controls, and construct a sex-specific regulatory network. This integrative approach aspires to enhance our understanding of RA pathogenesis from a gendered perspective and contribute to the development of personalized treatment strategies, ultimately advancing precision medicine in RA. The workflow of this study was illustrated in Figure  Flowchart of this study. ceRNA = competing endogenous ribonucleic acid, DEGs = differentially expressed genes, GEO = gene expression omnibus, GO = Gene Ontology, KEGG = Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, MR = Mendelian randomization, PBMCs = peripheral blood mononuclear cells, RA = rheumatoid arthritis. The recruitment period for this study began on 16-07-2021 and ended on 31-12-2022. We selected a total of 152 patients with RA who were admitted to the Department of Rheumatology and Immunology at Dazhou Central Hospital from July 2021 to December 2022 as the RA group. There were 123 female patients and 29 male patients. The study protocol, approved by the Ethics Committee of Dazhou Central Hospital (approval number: 2021-022), ensured the ethical conduct of the research. All participants voluntarily took part in the study and provided informed consent. Each participant signed a written consent form. This study adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All methods were conducted in strict compliance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Patients who met the diagnostic criteria for RA according to either the 1987 American College of Rheumatology or the 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism guidelines were included. The age of the participants was ≥18 years, irrespective of gender. Patients with acute or chronic infectious diseases, patients with significant medical conditions affecting the heart, brain, liver, kidney, or blood, patients with malignant tumors or mental disorders, and pregnant or lactating women were excluded. Upon enrollment, a fasting venous blood sample (2.0–3.0 mL) was collected from participants in the RA group. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were then isolated from these samples. RNA was extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China) and assessed for quantity and quality with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Shanghai, China) to meet analysis standards. The RNA sample preparation involved purifying mRNA from total RNA using poly-T magnetic beads, fragmenting it with elevated temperatures and divalent cations, synthesizing 1st strand cDNA with random hexamer primers and M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase, degrading RNA with RNase H, synthesizing 2nd strand cDNA with DNA polymerase I and dNTPs, smoothing DNA fragment ends, adenylating 3′ ends, ligating hairpin loop adaptors, isolating cDNA fragments of 370 to 420 bp via AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter, Beverly), and purifying amplified products to construct the sequencing library. The library, once qualified, was pooled according to effective concentration and desired sequencing volume, then sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. This process generated paired-end reads of 150 bp. The data underwent initial quality checks to ensure suitability for downstream analytical processes. The RA datasets ( We compared gene expression between female and male cohorts using our sequencing data. Differential genes were identified using the “limma” R package (version 3.40.6), applying a threshold of |log2 fold change| > 1 and a false discovery rate < 0.05. We visualized the results with volcano plots and heatmaps, employing the “ggplot2” and “pheatmap” R packages, respectively. We used the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes REST API ( This study employed a dual strategy combining least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) to select gender-associated key genes. In the data preprocessing phase, clinical gender labels were integrated with differential expression data based on sample IDs to construct a standardized expression matrix (Z-score normalization). LASSO regression was implemented using the glmnet package (v4.1-8), with the elastic net parameter set to α = 1 (pure L1 penalty). The regularization path spanned λ = 10⁻⁵ to 10² over 100 logarithmic intervals. Ten-fold stratified cross-validation was used to determine the optimal penalty coefficient (λ.min = 0.008) and to extract the nonzero coefficient genes. SVM-RFE, implemented using the e1071 and msvmRFE packages, After identifying 6 pivotal genes (MAP7D2, AR, DNAH6, CXorf36, ORM1, IQGAP3), logistic regression analysis was conducted to construct a nomogram model, employing the “rms” R package. The diagnostic efficacy of these 6 hub genes was appraised by plotting the ROC curve, utilizing the “ ROCR” R package. The validation of the diagnostic model, predicated on the 6 hub genes, was conducted using the  The infiltration scores of 16 immune cells and the activity levels of 13 immune functions in both female and male RA groups were determined using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) through the “gsva” package in R. These scores were subsequently visualized using heatmaps created with the “pheatmap” package. Interacting miRNAs linked to key DEGs were identified utilizing StarBase ( In this study, we employed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as IVs to investigate the causal relationship between 30DEGs as the exposure and RA as the outcome.

The causal estimate of MR studies must meet the following 3 assumptions: assumption 1, the selected genetic instruments must be powerfully associated with exposure (30 DEGs); assumption 2, the selected genetic instruments are unrelated to the potential confounders; assumption 3, the selected genetic instruments do not affect outcome (rheumatoid arthritis) independently of exposure (30 DEGS).

Our study utilized summary-level data from GWASs of European and Finnish ancestries (Table  For the study of RA, we obtained summary-level GWAS data from the FinnGen consortium ( We employed a series of quality control steps based on GWAS summary results to select appropriate IVs. Initially, SNPs with genome-wide significance ( In this study, we explored the bidirectional causality between 30 DEGs and RA using a 3-sample MR approach. To infer causality, especially with multiple IVs, we employed several methods: inverse-variance weighting (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode. We prioritized the IVW method due to its high statistical power. To ensure the robustness of our findings, we employed various sensitivity analysis methods. Initially, the IVW approach was used to evaluate heterogeneity among IVs, with Cochran’s  We utilized R software (version 4.3.2) for all statistical analyses. To explore the relationship between DEGs and both immune cell infiltration and functional activity, we applied Spearman’s rank correlation. All MR analyses were performed using the “Two-Sample MR” and “MRPRESSO” packages. A  In total, 30 genes were found to be differentially expressed when comparing female and male samples in our sequencing data, of which 11 and 19 were upregulated and downregulated and visualized by the volcano plot and heatmap (Fig.  Functional enrichment analysis indicated that the DEGs were mainly involved in regulation of morphogenesis of an epithelium, regulation of morphogenesis of a branching structure, neutrophil – mediated killing of symbiont cell, neutrophil – mediated killing of bacterium, azurophil granule, primary lysosome, vacuolar lumen, azurophil granule lumen, serine hydrolase activity, serine – type peptidase activity, serine – type endopeptidase activity, heparin binding (Fig.  Functional analyses of the DEGs.

The LASSO and SVM-RFE machine learning algorithms were next implemented to identify hub DEGs capable of reliably differentiating between RA female and male patients. In LASSO analyses with 10-fold cross-validation-based penalty parameter tuning, 16 DEGs were selected (Fig.  Six hub DEGs were identified as diagnostic genes.

These hub DEGs were used to define a ceRNA network comprising 461 nodes (6 DEGs, 73 miRNAs, and 382 lncRNAs) and 965 edges (Fig.  ceRNA networks based on 6 hub genes.

In our study, we selected IVs significantly linked to 30 DEGs from GWAS, employing a stringent significance threshold ( We conducted MR analysis on 30 DEGs to explore their potential causal relationships with RA. Among these genes, only the RETN gene showed a significant causal relationship with seronegative RA. Using the IVW method, we found that the association between RETN and seronegative RA was statistically significant ( Mendelian randomization estimates of the casual relationships between RETN and RA.

Our findings underscore the importance of sex-specific genetic factors in the pathogenesis of RA, an autoimmune disorder with complex and incompletely understood mechanisms. While previous studies have identified various genes associated with RA, the role of sex-based genetic variations has not been comprehensively explored. The significant differences observed in disease progression and clinical manifestations between male and female patients emphasize the need for a deeper investigation into how sex-specific genetic variations contribute to RA. Understanding these differences could help tailor more effective, gender-specific treatments for RA patients. In our analysis, we identified 30 DEGs between female and male RA patients, with 11 genes upregulated and 19 downregulated. Notable genes included MAP7D2, AR, DNAH6, CXorf36, ORM1, and IQGAP3. Visualization of these findings through volcano and heat maps revealed significant disparities in gene expression ( DEGs also exhibit potential utility in the diagnosis and treatment of RA. Specific DEGs, such as ORM1and AR, could function as novel biomarkers for early diagnosis and monitoring of RA progression. Moreover, these genes may serve as therapeutic targets in personalized medicine, facilitating more tailored treatment strategies for patients of different sexes. Elevated ORM1 expression may promote neutrophil production and activation, worsening joint inflammation and damage. ORM1 also influences inflammatory cytokine release, shaping the local immune environment and advancing RA progression, particularly in female patients, Through ssGSEA analysis, it was found that the levels of immune cell infiltration, including B cells, CD8 After constructing a diagnostic model based on 6 core genes and validating its effectiveness, results showed that the model achieved an AUC of 0.956 in the training set and an AUC of 0.859 in the validation set ( We developed a ceRNA network using 5 diagnostic markers to investigate their regulatory mechanisms, highlighting miRNAs as key epigenetic regulators in RA. The pathways XIST-hsa-miR-124-3p and others may regulate disease progression. In RA, female synovial cells likely transform into fibroblast-like synoviocytes and osteoclasts via LNC-XIST-mediated miRNA modulation, Our MR analysis of 30 DEGs identified RETN as the only gene significantly linked to seronegative RA, showing a significant association ( Our findings highlight the significant role of RETN gene expression in increasing RA risk, particularly among seronegative and female patients. Elevated RETN expression notably heightens RA risk in females, suggesting distinct mechanisms by which RETN influences RA development across genders. This gender-specific effect points to the need for gender-tailored therapeutic approaches and underscores the importance of integrating gender differences into RA research and treatment. Gender disparities in RA are well-established, with women exhibiting a markedly higher incidence and different disease progression than men. Through MR analysis and IVW methods, our study not only confirms the link between the RETN gene and RA but also reveals for the 1st time RETN’s specific role in female RA patients. Elevated RETN expression significantly raises seronegative RA risk in women, reinforcing earlier findings and emphasizing the need to consider gender differences in RA pathogenesis and treatment. The study findings, based on a specific sample, may not be directly generalizable due to genetic, environmental, and demographic variations. Future research should include diverse ethnic and age groups to validate the consistency of gender-specific gene expression and immune response in RA across populations. Additionally, analyzing gene expression at different RA stages – early onset, remission, and flare-up – would help assess the stability of these patterns. Further investigation into varying disease severities would enhance understanding of gene expression’s relationship to disease intensity, improving the model’s applicability for predicting RA risk and progression and supporting personalized treatment. This study has limitations, including a small sample size affecting result generalizability, the need for experimental validation of identified DEGs and ceRNA networks, and further clinical data validation for the machine learning model. Gender differences complicate understanding biological processes, necessitating more research on sex hormones and gene interactions. Although the RETN gene shows promise as a biomarker, translating findings into clinical applications poses challenges. Additionally, confounding factors like lifestyle and genetics may influence results, requiring future studies to address these for accuracy. Continuous research is essential to overcome these limitations and enhance understanding and treatment of RA. This research systematically reveals the significant role of sex-specific genetic variations in the pathogenesis of RA using large-scale sequencing data. Through our analysis, we identified key genes such as DNAH6, ORM1, and AR, which exhibit significant expression differences between genders, indicating distinct molecular mechanisms in male and female RA patients.

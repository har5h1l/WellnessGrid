The ligand PHY achieved a drug score of 0.81, binding affinity of −8.84 kcal/mol, ligand efficiency of 0.43, and inhibition constant (KI) of 10.8 nM, indicating it to be a potential ligand for developing antibiotics that target DHPS. Despite having weaker binding energy, PHY again demonstrated a lower KI value, indicating potential as a promising ligand for developing antibiotics targeting DHPS and TYRS [ TYRS are essential enzymes involved in protein synthesis. Its primary function is to catalyze the attachment of tyrosine to its respective tRNA molecule. TYRS is a crucial target for developing antimicrobial drugs because it plays a vital role in translating genetic information into proteins. Bacterial TYRS has distinct structural and functional characteristics compared to its eukaryotic counterparts, which scientists have utilized to develop specific inhibitors. These inhibitors can interfere with bacterial protein synthesis, reducing the growth or death of bacterial cells [ MD simulation was conducted to further investigate the structural stability, dynamic behavior, and interaction mechanisms of biomolecular complexes between the proteins: TYRS and DHPS and the ligand: PHY and OFL under physiological conditions.

VALUES ('High prevalence of unrecognized chronic kidney disease in the Lolland-Falster Health Study: a population-based study in a rural provincial area of Denmark', 'Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 10–15% globally and is a marked independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Prevalence estimations are essential for public health planning and implementation of CKD treatment strategies. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and stages of CKD in the population-based Lolland-Falster Health Study, set in a rural provincial area with the lowest socioeconomic status in Denmark. Additionally, the study characterized participants with CKD, evaluated the overall disease recognition, including the awareness of CKD and compared it with other common conditions. Cross-sectional data were obtained from clinical examinations, biochemical analyses, and questionnaires. CKD was defined as albuminuria (urine albumin–creatinine ratio ≥30 mg/g), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m², or by a diagnosis in the National Patient Register. Patient awareness was assessed by self-reported CKD, and overall disease recognition by either a registered hospital diagnosis or self-reported CKD. Among 16 097 adults (median age 58.6 years), CKD prevalence was 18.0% (n = 2903), with 70.1% identified by albuminuria, 28.4% by reduced eGFR, and 1.5% by a registered diagnosis alone. Of those with CKD, 98.8% had stages 1–3 (eGFR ≥30 ml/min/1.73 m²), and 1.2% had stages 4–5 (eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m²). Female sex, comorbidities, smoking, and low socioeconomic parameters were independently associated with CKD. Patient awareness of CKD was 4.4%, compared to >50% for hypertension and >80% for diabetes, and the overall CKD recognition (self-reported or registered diagnosis) was 7.1%. Thus, in this population-based study, CKD was highly prevalent but poorly recognized, indicating great potential for preventing CKD progression and related complications. Additional content an author video to accompany this article is available at:  Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects over 10% of the global adult population, is becoming more prevalent and has emerged as the 11th leading cause of death [ Patients with CKD often have no or very few symptoms, leaving both the patients and clinicians unaware of the condition. This lack of awareness impedes timely intervention to prevent CKD progression and complications, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) [ In Denmark, stage 3–5 CKD prevalence is approximately 5% [ Denmark is a small high-income country with a population of approximately 5.9 million. Despite having a tax-funded healthcare system with free hospital access and relative genetic homogeneity within the population, health outcomes in Denmark vary considerably by region [ As part of LOFUS, the present cross-sectional study investigated the epidemiology of CKD. Unlike register-based studies, this study assessed CKD prevalence by systematic examination of albuminuria and decreased estimated GFR (eGFR), covering both early and late stages. Additionally, the study characterized participants with CKD and identified individuals who were unaware of their condition or unrecognized by the healthcare system. We hypothesized that the prevalence of CKD in Lolland-Falster was >10% and that the proportion of unrecognized CKD was >50%, thus representing a substantial public health issue contributing to the health disparities in the area. Randomly selected adults (≥18 years) were invited to participate in LOFUS together with members of their household, regardless of age [ Data on study participants’ contact with hospitals were collected from the Danish National Patient Register (DNPR), a nationwide hospital register providing longitudinal data on inpatient contacts since 1977 and outpatient and emergency department contacts since 1995 [ CKD was defined in accordance with Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) recommendations in terms of albuminuria (UACR above 30 mg/g) or eGFR below 60 ml/min/1.73 m Prevalent CVD was defined as a diagnosis of CVD, either self-reported (i.e. atherosclerosis, angina pectoris, deep vein thrombosis, or taking medication for atrial fibrillation) or listed in the DNPR. Blood pressure was measured using a standardized protocol, and the last of three consecutive measurements was used for evaluation [ Data on socioeconomic status were obtained from the questionnaire. The question regarding occupational status had 16 different response options. These were divided into the following four categories in the analyses:  Categorical variables are presented as proportions and continuous variables as means with standard deviations or medians with interquartile ranges. Since several participants were from the same household, generalized linear mixed-effects models with household as a random effect were used to account for this clustering and estimate !odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All tests were two-sided, and a  A total of 16 142 adults participated in LOFUS, but 45 participants were excluded due to missing data for both plasma creatinine and UACR. Therefore, 16 097 participants were included in the current study.

IQR, interquartile range; SD, standard deviation. Compared to the non-CKD group, individuals with CKD were older and had a higher prevalence of comorbidities ( The proportion of individuals with inactive occupational status was 60.3% in the CKD group and 33.4% in the non-CKD group. Most individuals in both groups had a short postsecondary education, whereas the proportion of individuals with no postsecondary education was slightly higher among those with CKD than those without.

Among the 2903 individuals with CKD, 4.4% ( Participants with CKD stratified by unrecognized/recognized  Not including the individuals with unspecified CKD stage. Hypertension defined by either blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg, a registered diagnosis, or a self-reported diagnosis or use of antihypertensive medication. In this population-based study, we found a CKD prevalence of 18.0%, predominantly based on the presence of moderately increased albuminuria. Over 90% of individuals with CKD were not previously hospital diagnosed or aware of their condition. The findings confirm our hypothesis that CKD represents a substantial but underrecognized public health concern in this rural provincial area of Denmark. Female sex, comorbidities including obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and CVD, as well as factors indicative of low socioeconomic status, were independently associated with CKD. We found a high prevalence of CKD compared to several other European countries. For example, the Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT) in Norway reported a CKD prevalence of 11.1% in the 2006–2008 cohort ( Regarding the prevalence of stage 3–5 CKD (5.1%) in our study, we noted similarities in other Scandinavian studies [ In our study, the proportion of individuals with recognized CKD was low (7.1%) but consistent with similar studies [ CKD is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular complications and mortality, even in its early stages with normal eGFR and low levels of albuminuria [ Consistent with prior research our findings also establish the significant association between CKD and low educational level, especially a lack of postsecondary education [ Our study was subject to certain limitations. First, because this was a cross-sectional study, we lacked repeated measurements of eGFR and UACR over time. Consequently, there was a risk of overestimating CKD prevalence based on transient decreases in eGFR and increases in UACR [ We report the largest and most comprehensive CKD prevalence study to date in Denmark, based not merely on register data but on systematic clinical and paraclinical examination of a randomly selected population. The data regarding albuminuria were almost complete, providing valuable information on the early asymptomatic stages of CKD, which is generally underrepresented in register-based studies. Moreover, previous population-based studies in Denmark were conducted on urban populations, whereas our study examines a rural provincial population. This unique feature of LOFUS enhances the generalizability of the findings by adding valuable insights from non-urban areas [ Most individuals with unrecognized CKD were identified based on the presence of moderately increased albuminuria. Therefore, it emphasizes the importance of testing for albuminuria, especially in high-risk groups such as those with diabetes, hypertension, and CVD, to timely detect individuals for whom initiation of treatment is indicated [ In this large population-based study, we found that CKD was highly prevalent, but most individuals were not aware of this condition and did not carry a hospital diagnosis, highlighting a substantial but hidden public health concern.

VALUES ('Periprosthetic Joint Infection: A Multifaceted Burden Undermining Arthroplasty Success', 'Despite advancements in surgical techniques and implant designs, Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) continues to be one of the commonest and most devastating causes of failure in total joint arthroplasty. PJIs are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, placing a multifactorial burden on patients, caregivers, surgeons, hospitals, health systems, and economies. The incidence of PJI ranges from 0.5% to 2.3% based on current literature. Mortality rates in PJI subsequent to a primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) range from 4% to 8% after one year. The common treatment for PJI is a two-stage revision THA, which itself is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The economic burden of PJI is substantial, with treatment costs 3 to 5.6 times higher than primary THA. Patients with PJI experience inferior hip function, lower health-related quality of life scores, and higher odds of developing new onset depression. PJI’s negatively impacts on a patient’s capacity to work and conduct everyday activities. Orthopaedic surgeons also face significant psychological stress due to the challenges in managing PJI, including feelings of incompetence, insecurity, and frustration. Continued research and innovation are essential to optimize THA outcomes and reduce the need for revision surgeries. Improved prevention strategies, multidisciplinary cooperation, and comprehensive care and support for both patients and surgeons are crucial. It is paramount that every orthopaedic surgeon remains cognisant of this complication to institute better prevention strategies, promote better multi-disciplinary cooperation and enhance patient pre-operative care.', 'PubMed_Central', 'diabetes_management', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/', 'research_article', '{"content_hash": "99b88226793f0d1c", "embedding_date": "2025-06-25T14:21:07.396674", "scraper_source": "PubMed_Central", "category": "research_literature", "subcategory": "pubmed_central", "document_type": "research_article", "published_date": "", "original_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/"}', 1676);

VALUES ('A Review of the Role of Paraprobiotics in the Formulation of High-Protein Ice Cream as an Advanced Functional Food', 'Paraprobiotics are nonvital bacteria that have health benefits. Recently, they have been incorporated into dairy products as supplements to probiotics. The advantages of using paraprobiotics mainly include superior resistance to processing conditions, extended shelf-life, and safer consumption by people with weaker immune systems. In high-protein ice cream, paraprobiotics enhance freezing stability and eliminate the risks of microbial overgrowth and rare adverse effects. They also promote gut health, regulate immune responses, and have anti-inflammatory properties, which are important for children. Moreover, paraprobiotics enhance the functional value of high-protein ice cream by promoting gut health and immune support, making it an ideal functional supplement for athletes and bodybuilders. This review discusses recent developments in high-protein ice cream fortified with paraprobiotics, focusing on product stability, texture, and consumer acceptance while addressing challenges in the sensory quality of the final product. The concept of functional foods has its roots in long-standing traditions of health promotion through diet, dating back to thousands of years ago and evolving with advancements in science and technology. As the knowledge of food–human body interactions has grown, it has become evident that the nutritional and functional properties of certain foods can be enhanced by incorporating bioactive ingredients. High-protein ice cream fortified with paraprobiotics represents an innovative functional food promoting satiety, supporting muscle growth, and improving metabolism. However, the lactose, fat, and protein contents of traditional ice creams can pose challenges to individuals with lactose intolerance, milk protein allergies, or dietary restrictions [ Many dairy products, commonly used as carriers of probiotics, have unfavorable conditions for the survival of paraprobiotics. For instance, the high acidity of yogurt or thermal processes such as pasteurization and sterilization often result in a reduction or complete loss of viable probiotic cells [ Numerous clinical studies have been conducted on the use of paraprobiotics in dairy products, which can inform their application in high-protein ice cream. For example, a study on the yogurt containing the paraprobiotic  Additionally, another study indicated that daily consumption of the yogurt containing the inactivated cells of  Dairy products remain the primary carriers of probiotics and paraprobiotics; however, attention has recently shifted toward incorporating these ingredients into nondairy foods and supplements. This shift is driven by factors such as lactose intolerance, milk allergies, concerns about fat and cholesterol, vegetarian diets, and the presence of antibiotics and hormones in dairy products. Paraprobiotics have the advantage of high stability under various conditions and, unlike live probiotics, can be used in dry foods, beverages, and supplements without losing quality [ In a randomized controlled clinical trial by Barros et al. [ Paraprobiotics have also been used in nutritional supplements as alternatives to live probiotics, providing insights applicable to high-protein ice cream formulation. Studies have shown paraprobiotics can effectively enhance the immune system, lower inflammation, improve digestive system function, and alleviate the symptoms of stress and depression. These are the benefits that could enhance the functional properties of paraprobiotic-containing ice cream. For instance, supplementation with heat-inactivated  High-protein ice cream enriched with paraprobiotics is emerging as one of the most significant innovations in the food industry, owing to the growing demand for healthier functional foods. This innovation strikes a balance between the nutritional value and popularity of ice cream as a healthy snack [ The development of high-protein ice cream supplemented with paraprobiotics stands out as one of the most important innovations in the food industry, because of the growing demand for healthier functional foods. There is an increased health awareness related to functional foods which could help alleviate a number of health disorders associated with digestion, metabolic disorders, and immune system deficiencies. Paraprobiotics represent a new frontier of functional enrichment of foods. Owing to being viable, biologically active probiotics do not resist any of the issues associated with live microorganisms such as storage problems [ Paired with high-protein ice cream, paraprobiotics also enable the manufacturer to market a functional dessert supportive of muscle synthesis and metabolism, along with gut health and immune system function. This is rather important in the wake of increasing lactose intolerance and diets that avoid certain food components, as traditional ice cream contains fat and lactose, both of which decrease its acceptability. The paraprobiotics help in allaying these concerns by offering health benefits similar to those of live probiotics, without the strict storage conditions or any viability concern in variable temperature conditions [ More importantly, the development of paraprobiotic-enriched high-protein ice cream fits in with the current paradigm in combating chronic diseases like obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, all caused by dietary inputs. This functional ice cream with incorporated paraprobiotics further pushes the health-conscious customer paradigm for potential cholesterol reduction, gut microbiota management, and overall metabolic health [ While the formulation and benefits of such products will be analyzed, an effort is made to judge the role of paraprobiotics in converting a conventional convenience food into a health-promoting functional food. Until now, no application of paraprobiotics has been reported in ice cream formulation. This review is aimed at discussing the technologies related to paraprobiotic production, the formulation of high-protein ice cream, and the benefits of incorporating paraprobiotics into such ice cream. It also investigates the impacts of paraprobiotics on gut function and the immune system, ultimately positioning high-protein ice cream as a healthy functional food dessert for athletes. Paraprobiotics exhibit biological functions similar to live probiotics; nevertheless, since they are inactivated, they do not pose risks such as antibiotic resistance gene transfer and systemic infections. The immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties of paraprobiotics, such as those exhibited by  The potential of modulating immune responses and promoting the host health plays a crucial role in assessing the probiotic activity of bacterial strains. At the same time, the precise identification of the components of bacterial cells involved in immune cell interactions remains a challenge [ In a project performed by Taverniti et al. [ Paraprobiotics such as  The bacterial cell wall components, namely PGN, TA, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), significantly influence the biological activity of paraprobiotics. PGN, the major component of the cell wall in Gram-positive bacteria, consists of the polysaccharide chains of N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) linked by  The immunomodulatory activities of paraprobiotics are bidirectional; they can stimulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-2, IL-12, IL-8, TNF- TA and PGN in the cell wall of certain  The stimulation and modulation of the immune system by the cell wall components such as PGN in probiotics (viable microorganisms) and paraprobiotics (nonviable microbial components or lysates) occur through various mechanisms [ In a research project performed by Hatami et al. [ Retention of the gut barrier integrity plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses and reducing inflammation. The intestinal epithelial barrier prevents the direct contact between microbes and the gut cells via mechanisms like the mucus layer and the production of antibacterial molecules like regenerating islet-derived protein III-gamma (RegIII In addition, the vagus nerve–dependent inflammatory reflex also has a role in lowering inflammation by inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines. This mechanism involves the release of acetylcholine receptors and the activation of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( Studies have shown that paraprobiotics can diminish intestinal permeability by improving the expression of cell junction proteins such as claudin and occludin [ Isolation has an important role in understanding the health advantages of paraprobiotics as well as their modes of action. For separation, a variety of methods are employed, including techniques of cell disruption, heat treatment, freezing, drying, irradiation with gamma rays or UV light, high-pressure processing (HPP), and chemical treatment [ As an example of the thermal treatments listed in  Furthermore, it reversed the immunosuppressive effects of cyclophosphamide (CTX) by repairing splenic impairment and regaining the immune organ index. While IL-2 was decreased, the immune-related cytokines in the spleen and thymus elevated IL-1 The methods of cell membrane protein denaturation seem to represent the best approach for obtaining paraprobiotics. Treatment techniques often directly target the bacterial cell membrane and proteins. These techniques allow the degradation of the bacterial cell wall but preserve the integrity of major immunomodulatory components such as PGNs and fragments from the cell wall. According to Lee et al. [ Following the evaluation of inactivation methods for paraprobiotic production and their diverse health benefits such as immune system modulation and gut health enhancement, this section explores their application in high-protein ice cream, focusing on the resulting paraprobiotic properties and technological characteristics essential for functional food development. High-protein ice cream, as an innovative functional food, offers a suitable platform for the incorporation of paraprobiotics derived from probiotic strains such as  Thermal treatments, such as pasteurization at 60°C for 40 min or 80°C for 15 min, are suitable to inactivate  Nonthermal methods, including HPP (100–600 MPa) and high-intensity ultrasound (20 kHz, 792 W/cm Irradiation (gamma rays, 4–6.5 kGy) and chemical treatments (e.g., pH 1 or 12.5) are less suitable for high-protein ice cream, due to the significant degradation of PGN and EPS [ Supercritical carbon dioxide (8–30 MPa, 40°C) is effective on  The choice of inactivation method should balance the preservation of bioactive components, sensory quality, and industrial feasibility. Nonthermal methods like HPP and ultrasound are more suitable to produce high-protein ice creams containing paraprobiotics, because of their ability to preserve EPS, enhance texture, and improve sensory quality [ The high-protein ice cream discussed in this review is conceptualized as a functional carrier for paraprobiotics, formulated with 5%–7% fat (derived from cream and milk fat), 30%–35% solids-not-fat (SNF), including 15.02%–18.59% protein (sourced from milk protein concentrate (MPC) and whey protein isolate (WPI)), and 35%–40% total solids (TS) comprising sweeteners (e.g., sucralose) and stabilizers (e.g., guar gum). This composition was designed to ensure the stability of paraprobiotics during freezing and enhance nutritional value, aligned with findings on high-protein ice cream formulations [ Regarding protein sources, in order to achieve a target of 15% protein, 15% whey protein concentrate (WPC, 80% protein) alone is insufficient, as it contributes approximately 12% protein (15 × 0.8 = 12%) [ The role of paraprobiotics in the formulation of functional foods like high-protein ice cream is gaining attention, owing to their potential health benefits and technological advantages. Paraprobiotics derived from  Research on the effects of paraprobiotics, particularly their PGN components, has revealed significant benefits for intestinal function and disease treatment. PGN, which is a moiety of the bacterial cell wall, has a substantial effect on immune system stimulation even if the cell is nonviable. In the gut, they help modulate the immune response by PRRs, including TLRs, on the intestinal epithelium. This interaction enhances the generation of anti-inflammatory cytokines, which help maintain gut homeostasis and protect against inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) [ TAs account for as much as 50% of the dry weight of lactobacilli cell walls [ 
 In addition to PGN, other cell wall components like polysaccharides also have a considerable effect on the functionality of paraprobiotics. Polysaccharides are commonly found on the surface of Gram-positive bacteria such as  Paraprobiotics have several key technological advantages over live probiotics, particularly in the formulation of high-protein ice cream, as they can be added to the ice cream without concerns for survival during processing, storage, and distribution. While live probiotics are susceptible to heat, high pressure, and acidic conditions, paraprobiotics remain stable and retain their functional properties under adverse conditions including high temperatures, HPP, low pH, and long storage times [ Furthermore, paraprobiotics enhance the functional value of food products by providing health benefits such as immune system modulation and gut health improvement, similar to live probiotics, but with greater stability. If viable probiotics are taken in wrong proportions, they will cause problems such as bacterial overgrowth or loss of viability during industrial processes [ Protein is a crucial macronutrient needed for tissue structures and the control of many physiological processes. In addition to providing approximately 4 kcal/g, protein is necessary for body growth. For men weighing about 65 kg, the recommended daily intake of protein is 54 g, and adjusting the protein intake based on individual needs is essential for optimal performance and recovery. Athletes typically require 1.2–2.0 g of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, depending on their training and goals [ High-protein ice creams with reduced sugar or sweetened with natural sweeteners serve as a dietary supplement for athletes and a potential dessert option for individuals with conditions like diabetes, provided the formulations meet low-glycemic requirements. The growing consumer interest in high-protein frozen desserts is evidenced by commercial products such as Breyer''s Delights, Chilly Cow, Enlightened, Halo Top, and Skinny Cow, which are perceived to be healthier due to their elevated protein content, with milk protein, whey protein, and ultrafiltered milk being preferred over casein or plant-based proteins [ High-protein frozen desserts are recognized for meeting the nutritional needs of specific populations such as those requiring increased protein intake [ In this review, high-protein ice cream is defined as a type of ice cream containing approximately 15.05%–18.59% (wt.) protein based on experimental formulations utilizing WPI, which is significantly higher than that of traditional ice cream (typically 2.6%–4.6% wt.). This classification is supported by industry trends rather than specific regulatory standards, as no minimum protein content is mandated for this category by regulatory bodies like the FDA or EFSA, even though nutritional claims are governed by regulations such as EU No. 1924/2006 [ High-protein ice cream has gained popularity in recent years, with various protein sources employed to enhance its nutritional profile. The selection of protein ingredients significantly influences both the nutritional value and functional properties of the final product.  The literature highlights several key protein sources utilized in the formulation of high-protein ice cream. For example: (a) WPI: studies show that incorporating WPI significantly increases the ice cream protein content (up to 10%). This high-protein additive enhances texture and consistency, owing to its functional properties, but may negatively affect sensory attributes such as melt score due to elevating the matrix density [ (b) MPC: this ingredient has been shown to closely simulate the sensory properties of traditional ice cream while raising the protein content by approximately 5%–7% ( (c) MCC powder and MPC are recent additives. Membrane and ion-exchange technologies have enabled the manufacture of such specific high-protein compounds, most of which are employed as specialized additives and offer food functionality including solubility, viscosity, gelation, emulsification, and foaming [ (d) Plant-based proteins: owing to their enhanced oil and water binding capacities, PPI and SPI have been investigated as alternatives to dairy-based proteins, specifically WPI and MPC, in high-protein ice cream formulations. However, compared with these dairy proteins, PPI and SPI are less flavorful and creamy [ Cow''s milk protein allergy (CMPA), affecting 2%–6% of infants and 0.16%–0.49% of adults, may cause gastrointestinal distress or anaphylaxis, necessitating dairy-free formulations [ (e): WPC: it has been noted for its nutritional benefits and has been effectively applied to increase protein content while maintaining desirable physicochemical properties [ Recent studies have also focused on functional ice creams enriched with whey protein gels and blueberries which, respectively, give rise to protein content and bioactive compounds while improving health benefits [ In summary, while various protein combinations have been used to produce high-protein ice cream, the choice of the protein source markedly affects the sensory and physical properties of the product. However, a challenge remains in balancing the protein content with flavor and texture, especially when using plant proteins. Sivasankari et al. [ Functional dietary components help to naturally prevent illnesses including digestive disorders, obesity, high cholesterol, and diabetes. As a result, bioactive substances such as paraprobiotics are frequently employed to provide food with functional characteristics. Dairy products including ice cream and yogurt are among the best foods for imparting useful characteristics. The fat content of these products may readily be lowered and enhanced with bioactive substances [ 
 The proteins used such as WPI, casein, and plant proteins like pea and soy, among others, are those that have been known to present benefits in muscle recovery, satiety, and nutrition enhancement in general. As proved by Salles et al. [ Conventional ice creams comprise low protein levels (2–5 wt.%), mainly derived from milk solids, that are insufficient to meet elevated nutritional demands. To address this, high-protein ice creams have been developed using protein powders such as WPI and MPC, achieving protein contents of 10%–18.59% (wt.). Although 10% (wt.) protein is commonly achievable in commercial formulations, experimental formulations in this review ( Inclusion of paraprobiotics in functional high-protein foods such as high-protein ice creams can be linked to their potential benefits in managing chronic diseases, for example, improving gut health and management of IBD. Dietary proteins and sugars in ice cream are formulated in a way that will ensure health in the digestive system or modulate the immune system to solve problems such as intestinal inflammation and metabolic syndrome [ Research has revealed the addition of bioactive compounds derived from probiotics to high-protein ice cream can affect textural properties (e.g., firmness, viscosity, and emulsion stability) and sensory attributes (e.g., taste, aroma, and mouthfeel). Due to their lack of need for viability in the final product, paraprobiotics can be a suitable option for products like ice cream, which are stored under freezing conditions where maintaining the survival of live microorganisms is challenging. Studies on probiotic ice creams have indicated that the inclusion of probiotics can result in a softer and more uniform texture while improving sensory acceptance. This effect is principally due to the production of EPS by probiotics, which act as emulsifying and stabilizing agents, thus reducing ice crystal sizes and enhancing creaminess [ The conceptualized formulation, with a TS content of 35%–40%, a high SNF content (30%–35%), and 10%–12% protein, was designed to enhance the melting resistance and structural integrity of high-protein ice cream. This composition, particularly the elevated protein content (10%–12%), contributed to the improved viscosity and stability of paraprobiotics within the frozen matrix, aligning with observations by [ Paraprobiotics have attracted noteworthy attention in the dairy industry for their potential applications as alternatives for traditional probiotics. Rather than presenting the idea of paraprobiotics, it will be put forward as well as the use of probiotics to gain added benefits [ Application of paraprobiotics in ice cream provides several advantages associated with stability, safety, and health promotion. In contrast to live probiotics, paraprobiotics are nonviable inactivated probiotic cells that can still produce health-promoting effects such as gut health improvement and immune system modulation. These features make them highly appropriate for ice cream where maintaining the viability of live probiotic bacteria is challenging under freezing conditions and during long-term storage. Their stability ensures that the added value of such preparations is retained in extreme conditions, making them ideal for frozen desserts. Although specific data on paraprobiotic cell density is limited, studies on probiotics suggest a minimum therapeutic threshold of 10 As explained by Szydłowska et al. [ In addition, paraprobiotics are not affected by storage conditions such as pH and temperature that normally influence the viability of living probiotic cells. This will ensure that the quality and health benefits of the products are maintained over time. The incorporation of paraprobiotics into ice cream gives the manufacturer an avenue to participate in the developing market of functional foods for health-conscious consumers seeking added health benefits to the basic nutrition [ Excessive intake may still occur in specific consumers, including athletes or individuals following high-protein diets, who may consume large quantities to meet their own nutritional goals, potentially increasing the risk of digestive discomfort [ The incorporation of live probiotics into ice cream has garnered attention for their potential health benefits; however, several studies highlight significant challenges related to the product quality and consumer acceptance, which paraprobiotic-containing ice creams are aimed at addressing. A primary issue is sensory modifications caused by the metabolites produced by probiotics. Probiotics generate organic acids such as lactic and acetic acids, particularly during fermentation, which can impart sour or vinegary flavors, lowering sensory acceptance. For instance,  Turkmen et al. [ Although certain probiotic metabolites, such as EPS produced by strains like  In contrast, paraprobiotics, being inactivated, do not ferment and thus avoid producing undesirable metabolites like organic acids or volatile compounds. This preserves the traditional ice cream sensory attributes, including sweetness and uniform texture. Moreover, paraprobiotics eliminate the risks of microbial overgrowth or rare complications associated with live probiotics, making them safer for consumers with compromised immunity [ Incorporating paraprobiotics into high-protein ice cream formulations represents a revolutionary approach to producing functional foods that combine sensory pleasure with health benefits such as improved gut health and immune system modulation. Unlike live probiotics, paraprobiotics exhibit superior stability during freezing and long-term storage, preserving functional properties like texture, viscosity, and emulsion stability, making them ideal for frozen desserts where the retention of live probiotics'' viability is technologically challenging. Inactivation methods, such as mild thermal treatment (pasteurization at 60°C–80°C), HPP (100–600 MPa), and high-intensity ultrasound (20 kHz), play a critical role in preserving bioactive components like EPS. These methods enhance the ice cream texture, with thermal treatment increasing viscosity and firmness, HPP providing a softer texture and better resistance to ice crystal formation, and ultrasound creating a creamier mouthfeel and improved uniformity, all of which elevate sensory acceptance. The inactivated nature of paraprobiotics eliminates the risks of microbial overgrowth or rare adverse effects, enhancing safety for consumers with compromised immunity or at health risk. Furthermore, the addition of high protein content significantly enhances the nutritional value of ice cream, aligning with the growing consumer demand for healthier dessert options tailored to diverse dietary needs. WPI which is valued for its high protein purity, excellent solubility, texture enhancement, and nutritional benefits like muscle recovery and satiety and MPC which provides both casein and whey proteins for structural stability and enhanced nutritional value are optimal choices for these formulations. This review underscores the potential of high-protein ice cream containing paraprobiotics as an innovative functional food, highlighting the opportunities for further research to optimize the formulations, enhance sensory properties, and meet market demands.', 'PubMed_Central', 'diabetes_management', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/', 'research_article', '{"content_hash": "7c2814a6a6d29af9", "embedding_date": "2025-06-25T14:21:07.541167", "scraper_source": "PubMed_Central", "category": "research_literature", "subcategory": "pubmed_central", "document_type": "research_article", "published_date": "", "original_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/"}', 25812);

VALUES ('Trends in smoking-attributable cardiovascular mortality in Germany', 'We quantified the fraction of cardiovascular deaths attributable to smoking in Germany over time, accounting for population ageing. We calculated population-attributable fractions to quantify cardiovascular deaths attributable to smoking for 1992 to 2021, and compared actual with age-standardized figures. We found a significant decline in the number of cardiovascular deaths attributable to smoking: from about 71 900 cases in 1992 to around 42 000 cases in 2021, with a steeper decline in men. Age-standardized figures suggest that population ageing partially offset this trend. Forward projections indicate increasing trends over the next decade. The results highlight the need for targeted smoking cessation programmes. Even though Germany has been rather reluctant to implement tobacco control policies aimed at sustainably reducing smoking compared to other European countries, smoking rates have steadily declined over the past three decades [ During the same period, improved diagnostic and treatment options have led to a gradual decrease in mortality rates from cardiovascular diseases [ This study aims to quantify the fraction of cardiovascular deaths attributable to smoking in Germany over time, taking population ageing into account. The goal is to assess the impact of declining smoking rates and demographic trends on the evolution of cardiovascular mortality. To calculate the number of cardiovascular deaths attributable to smoking, population-attributable fractions were used. This epidemiological metric reflects the proportion of deaths in a population that can be attributed to a risk factor. The calculation requires data on the prevalence of the risk factor in the population and the relative risk of mortality for diseases causally associated with the risk factor. Multiplying the population-attributable fractions with the number of deaths from these diseases yields the absolute number of deaths attributable to the risk factor. Data on smoking prevalence and mortality statistics from 1992 to 2021 were obtained from the Federal Statistical Office of Germany. Relative mortality risks for smoking-associated diseases were taken from the literature [ To assess the impact of population ageing on trends in cardiovascular deaths attributable to smoking, these numbers were compared with age-standardized figures, holding the age structure of 1992 constant (direct age standardization). To estimate the impact of population ageing on the future number of cardiovascular deaths attributable to smoking, a forward projection based on population forecasts from the Federal Statistical Office until 2035 was modelled, assuming that cardiovascular mortality rates would remain constant at 2021 levels and that current sex-specific smoking trends would continue. A similar approach has been previously applied for overall smoking-attributable mortality [ All absolute numbers were rounded to the nearest ten. Trends in smoking prevalence overall, and by sex and age group are shown in  The fraction of cardiovascular deaths attributable to smoking decreased over the observation period, from 17.3% in 1992 to 14.6% in 2021. However, there were sex-specific differences: a substantial decline in men (from 29.3% to 18.8%) and a slight increase in women (from 8.6% to 10.6%) (details not shown). When examining absolute numbers, the analysis showed a significant decline in the number of cardiovascular deaths attributable to smoking over the observation period: from about 71 900 cases in 1992 to around 42 000 cases in 2021. This decline was more pronounced in men than in women (men: reduction of about 24 800 cases; women: reduction of about 5100 cases) ( Estimated cardiovascular deaths attributable to smoking 1992–2021 in Germany, actual and age-standardized numbers. When examining the age-standardized numbers, an even more pronounced decline is observed, highlighting the impact of demographic changes on these trends. The differences between the actual and age-standardized figures were more marked in men than in women ( The forward projection of the number of cardiovascular deaths attributable to smoking suggests a slight increase for men, and a substantial rise for women of 37% by 2035 ( The results of this study indicate that cardiovascular mortality attributable to smoking has significantly decreased over the past three decades in Germany, although this trend has been partially offset by opposing demographic trends due to population ageing. The substantial reduction in absolute numbers seems to be mainly driven by the overall decline in cardiovascular mortality rates, while decreasing smoking rates might only play a secondary role. The results further suggest that over the next years, population ageing could halt or even reverse the decline in the number of cardiovascular deaths attributable to smoking observed in recent decades. This underscores the urgent need for tobacco control policies and targeted interventions to promote smoking cessation to reduce the disease burden caused by smoking. A recent study on life expectancy in Germany particularly highlights the importance of increasing efforts in cardiovascular risk management and prevention. It shows that Germany lags behind other high-income countries in life expectancy, which is primarily due to higher mortality rates among older adults and those nearing retirement age, largely driven by cardiovascular diseases [ Several limitations must be considered when interpreting the results of this study. First, the calculations rely on self-reported data on smoking behaviour, and on mortality statistics from the German Federal Statistical Office. Although these data sources are generally considered reliable, there is potential for inaccuracies and biases that could affect the precision of the estimates presented here. Second, the forward projection to 2035 assumes constant mortality rates and a continuation of recent smoking trends, which may not hold true in reality, and the results should therefore be interpreted with caution. Third, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an increase in overall mortality, with numerous direct and indirect impacts on cardiovascular mortality [ Nevertheless, these results provide valuable insights into the trends in cardiovascular mortality attributable to smoking in Germany and highlight the importance of targeted smoking cessation programmes to reduce cardiovascular mortality, particularly in middle-aged and older age groups. Lastly, there is also an urgent need to implement proven effective tobacco control policies to reduce smoking and promote smoking cessation.', 'PubMed_Central', 'cardiovascular_disease_prevention', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/', 'research_article', '{"content_hash": "34de974b91e2f4ad", "embedding_date": "2025-06-25T14:21:10.131665", "scraper_source": "PubMed_Central", "category": "research_literature", "subcategory": "pubmed_central", "document_type": "research_article", "published_date": "", "original_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/"}', 6647);

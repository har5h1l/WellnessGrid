VALUES ('WHO Health Topic: Obesity', 'Overview Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. A body mass index (BMI) over 25 is considered overweight, and over 30 is obese. In 2019, an estimated 5 million noncommunicable disease (NCD) deaths were caused by higher-than-optimal BMI. Rates of overweight and obesity continue to grow in adults and children. From 1990 to 2022, the percentage of children and adolescents aged 5–19 years living with obesity increased four-fold from 2% to 8% globally, while the percentage of adults 18 years of age and older living with obesity more than doubled from 7% to 16%.Obesity is one side of the double burden of malnutrition, and today more people are obese than underweight in every region except the South-East Asia Region. Once considered a problem only in high-income countries, today some middle-income countries have among the highest prevalence of overweight and obesity worldwide. Complications Overweight and obesity are major risk factors for a number of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease and stroke, which are the leading causes of death worldwide. Being overweight can also lead to diabetes and its associated conditions, including blindness, limb amputations, and the need for dialysis. Rates of diabetes have quadrupled since around the world since 1980. Carrying excess weight can lead to musculoskeletal disorders including osteoarthritis. Obesity is also associated with some cancers, including endometrial, breast, ovarian, prostate, liver, gallbladder, kidney and colon. The risk of these noncommunicable diseases increases even when a person is only slightly overweight and grows more serious as the body mass index (BMI) climbs. Obesity in childhood is associated with a wide range of serious health complications and an increased risk of premature onset of related illnesses. Studies have found that without intervention, children and adolescents with obesity will likely continue to be obese into adulthood. Prevention and Control Many of the causes of overweight and obesity are preventable and reversable. Although other factors are involved, the fundamental cause of obesity is an imbalance of calories consumed and calories expended. As global diets have changed in recent decades, there has been an increase in the consumption of energy-dense foods high in fat and free sugars. There has also been a decrease in physical activity due to the changing nature of many types of work, more access to transportation and increased urbanization.Lowering the risk of overweight and obesity includes reducing the number of calories consumed from fats and sugars, increasing the portion of daily intake of fruit, vegetables, legumes, whole grains and nuts, and engaging in regular physical activity (60 minutes per day for children and 150 minutes per week for adults). In babies, studies have shown that exclusive breastfeeding from birth to 6 months of age reduces the risk of infants becoming overweight or obese.

VALUES ('WHO Health Topic: Epilepsy', 'Overview Epilepsy is the most common chronic brain disease and affects people of all ages. More than 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy; nearly 80% of them live in low- and middle-income countries.An estimated 70% of people with epilepsy could be seizure free if properly diagnosed and treated. However, about three quarters of people with epilepsy in low-income countries do not get the treatment they need, and this rises to 90% in some countries. In many such countries, many health professionals do not have the training to recognize, diagnose and treat epilepsy. In most resource-poor countries, antiseizure medicines are not available.People with epilepsy and their families frequently suffer from stigma and discrimination. In many parts of the world the true nature of epilepsy has also long been distorted by myths, fear and mistaken notions about the disorder.WHO is working with ministries of health and partners to improve access to treatment for epilepsy. Symptoms and treatment Epilepsy is not contagious and is characterized by seizures, which occur because of temporary excessive electric activity in the brain. During seizures, people may lose consciousness or awareness, control of bowel or bladder function, they may not be able to hear or see properly, and their movements may become disturbed. The loss of movement control and sensation can cause injuries from falls. A diagnosis of epilepsy is made by a health professional if there is medical history of at least two seizures. Often this is further confirmed by electroencephalography (EEG), a painless technological method to record and study the electrical activity of the brain.   Treatment for epilepsy can be very effective. With antiseizure medicines, up to 70% of people living with epilepsy could become seizure free. After 2 years of taking medicines without any seizures, a health professional may advise stopping the medicines. Where medicines are not helpful in relieving the condition, some types of surgery can be beneficial. Since people with epilepsy have higher occurrence of psychological conditions such as anxiety and depression, psychosocial help is also useful. WHO response Previous WHO collaborative programmes on epilepsy have shown that integrating epilepsy care in primary health care can significantly reduce the epilepsy treatment gap. Based on the evidence-based methods of the WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP), WHO supports the training of primary care, non-specialist health care providers to diagnose, treat and follow up people with epilepsy. The WHO Programme on Reducing the Epilepsy Treatment Gap combined several innovative strategies to support access and care to services for people with epilepsy, thereby reducing the epilepsy treatment gap. The Programme was implemented in four countries – Ghana, Mozambique, Myanmar and Viet Nam.WHO published Improving the lives of people with epilepsy: a technical brief, which sets out the actions required to deliver an integrated approach to epilepsy care and treatment. This better meets the multifaceted needs of people with epilepsy.

VALUES ('Natural Progression of Rheumatic Aortic Valve Disease Following Mitral Valve Intervention: A 16-Year Single-Center Experience', 'Clinicians frequently encounter cases of multiple valvular heart disease, wherein the combination of stenotic or regurgitant lesions occurs on separate cardiac valves [ Patients who demonstrated rheumatic involvement of the AV following MV intervention for rheumatic MS or MR, which encompassed MV replacement (MVR), percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty (PMBV), and any other forms of MV intervention such as ringed annuloplasty at Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital between December 1st, 2008 and December 31st, 2023, were included. For patients who underwent multiple MV interventions, we considered the first intervention as the criteria for data collection. Three patients who had their initial MV intervention at another hospital were also included. Those who underwent concurrent or bygone intervention on the AV or lacked echocardiographic follow-up exceeding one year were excluded. Two clinicians specializing in echocardiography determined whether the AV disease had a rheumatic etiology. The severity grading of cardiac valve disease adhered to current echocardiography guidelines [ In cases of AS, severity was assessed based on echocardiographic measurements, including maximal transaortic velocity ( Defining severe AS remains somewhat elusive. In this study, we considered a case to be presumed severe AS if it met at least one of the three classical criteria:  The study protocol conforms to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki [ Statistical analyses were performed using R (Version 4.3.1, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). A total of 890 patients who underwent MV intervention for rheumatic MS or MR without concurrent AV intervention were initially screened for eligibility. Among them, 76 patients had AV involvement of rheumatic etiology and fulfilled the inclusion criteria of our study ( Mechanical MV was applied to 54 patients without any complications, except for one case that experienced unexpected cardiac arrest with successful resuscitation within a month of the surgery. Nine patients received a bioprosthetic MVR. Among them, one patient required a redo-MVR due to a tissue valve tear, while another patient underwent redo-MVR along with AV replacement (AVR) due to infective endocarditis. Ringed mitral annuloplasty was performed for one patient with severe MR. Out of the 12 cases who underwent PMBV, one underwent PMBV twice before requiring MVR, one case (Patient A, detailed below) underwent double valve replacement (DVR) for both the AV and MV after two PMBV procedures, and one case underwent MVR along with coronary artery bypass graft surgery nine years after PMBV due to unstable angina. Postoperative changes in AS severity, as compared to preoperative grades based on parameters such as AV  A 33-year-old female with severe MS was referred to our institution for PMBV as she was planning for pregnancy. The procedure was successfully performed, and she had a stable delivery. After a 7-year gap in follow-up, she returned with dyspnea and underwent a redo PMBV, which yielded suboptimal results. Postprocedural echocardiography confirmed persistent severe MS with moderate MR (II/IV). Her AV parameters were  A 66-year-old female underwent mechanical MVR and tricuspid valvuloplasty for severe MS and moderate TR. At the time of surgery, her AV profile showed Vmax 3.0 m/s, mPG 19 mmHg, and AVA 1.0 cm A 60-year-old female underwent tissue MVR, tricuspid annuloplasty, and Maze operation for severe MS, TR, and AF at another hospital. Eighteen years later, she developed infective endocarditis requiring a redo DVR and repeat maze operation. Her last stable echocardiogram before surgery showed  A 43-year-old female with severe MS underwent PMBV at another hospital before transferring to our institution for follow-up. At 66 years, she underwent mechanical MVR, tricuspid valvuloplasty, and Maze operation. Five years postoperatively, her AV profile was  A 51-year-old female underwent PMBV for severe MS. At that time, her AV profile was  A 49-year-old female underwent mechanical MVR for severe MS. At the time, her AV profile was  Notably, four (Patients C, D, E, and F) of the six cases were classified as having paradoxical LFLG severe AS, meeting criteria of AVA < 1.0 cm There were no instances where postoperative AR severity progressed to severe; changes in severity grading are depicted in  Consequently, three out of the 76 patients underwent AVR, whose AV disease category was classified as severe AS. In the group predominantly affected by severe MS for MV intervention, 16 showed deterioration of AS and only three demonstrated improvements. Among this group, 14 cases experienced an improvement in AR severity, while 15 exhibited an increased amount ( AF was newly diagnosed in 19 cases after MV intervention. Among them, 10 had undergone a Maze operation for AF previously, while the remaining nine cases developed de novo AF. Seven out of the nine cases with de novo AF were detected during the follow-up period after PMBV. There was one reported death among the 76 cases. Clinical events during follow-up are presented in  AS initiates damage in the left ventricle (LV) and may also lead to right ventricular injury, posing a risk of sudden cardiac death for the patient [ Diagnosing severe AS is a complex task and more so in the LFLG severe AS category. In our study, four cases (Patients C, D, E and F) are classified as having paradoxical LFLG severe AS despite normal EF category. This suggests a potential true-severe AS. While AVA, as an anatomical factor, indicates severe AS, the hemodynamic parameters, which lack sensitivity, do not fall within the high specificity range [ The timing of AV assessment after MV intervention is a crucial factor. Generally, LV function and remodeling recover within the first year after MV intervention, at which point the AV can be evaluated in a stable condition [ Invasive methods offer an alternative means to overcome the limitations of transthoracic echocardiography in grading AS severity. However, they present technical challenges and rely on a multitude of assumptions [ The optimal timing for valve intervention in the paradoxical LFLG severe AS remains unclear. Proper management may involve addressing the potential impact of concurrent heart failure with preserved EF by treating hypertension and carefully monitoring the detrimental effects of AS on LV filling pressure, rather than focusing solely on AVA. Until further elucidation, general medical therapy for heart failure appears to suffice [ Regarding perioperative risk, it is inappropriate to directly compare MVR alone and DVR, given their distinct patient baseline comorbidities, which can vary from center to center. However, when examining mortality rates, DVR appears to have an overall 5-year mortality ranging from 5% to 20%, while MVR with or without tricuspid valvuloplasty demonstrates a relatively lower value [ As observed in this study, patients with rheumatic cardiac valve disease tend to be younger than those with degenerative cardiac valve disease and may opt for mechanical prosthetic valves to avoid the need for repeat replacement. Patients with dual mechanical valves face a higher risk of thrombosis and are recommended to maintain a higher target international normalized ratio [ There is no established lower threshold of mPG for mild AS. In our study, the same population was categorized into both the mild AS and no AS groups when sorted according to AV Vmax and AVA criteria. Consequently, an mPG of 14 mmHg was proposed as the lower limit cutoff for mild AS. Among 18 patients whose preoperative assessment showed mild AS, five progressed to moderate AS, while one deteriorated to severe AS after four years of follow-up. Three out of nine patients who were assessed to have moderate AS at preoperative evaluation showed progression to severe AS after the median follow-up period of seven years (mean nine years). It is poorly understood why the patient with mild AS showed even more rapid progression to paradoxical LFLG severe AS than the moderate AS patients. Looking at the changes in AS and AR severity in  LVEF and LVWT significantly increased over time, while tissue Doppler early diastolic velocity ( Overall, 3.4–10.3% of patients with rheumatic involvement at AV develop severe AS with a substantial portion in the form of paradoxical LFLG severe AS, and few of them exhibit severe AR during the median follow-up period of five to six years after MV intervention. Our study has several limitations that need to be acknowledged. First, it is retrospective and observational in nature, which may introduce inherent biases. In addition, the presence of a substantial amount of missing data and a relatively short median follow-up period are important considerations. Focusing on patients with follow-up periods of over a year introduces potential survival bias, which should be taken into account when interpreting the results. Moreover, our study design does not allow us to make definitive conclusions about whether delaying AV intervention leads to improved clinical outcomes, especially in concerned patient groups. Identifying the specific factors contributing to patients falling into the paradoxical severe AS category and assessing whether patients undergoing MVR with rheumatic AV involvement are more susceptible to paradoxical severe AS were challenging. A larger sample size and further investigation may shed light on these aspects in future studies. The absence of long-term secondary prophylaxis with antirheumatic antibiotics represents another limitation of our study. This was primarily due to the low number of patients who started regular follow-ups before the age of 40 and the significant pain associated with benzathine penicillin G injections, even when mixed with lidocaine. Paradoxically, however, this lack of prophylaxis enabled us to more accurately demonstrate the natural progression of rheumatic heart disease. In conclusion, only a small portion of rheumatic AV involvement progresses to severe AS after MV intervention, and performing MV intervention for severe MS or MR in patients with concurrent mild or moderate AS or AR due to rheumatic changes is considered safe.', 'PubMed_Central', 'cardiovascular_disease_prevention', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/', 'research_article', '{"content_hash": "c697bcc8de706721", "embedding_date": "2025-06-25T14:21:10.594147", "scraper_source": "PubMed_Central", "category": "research_literature", "subcategory": "pubmed_central", "document_type": "research_article", "published_date": "", "original_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/"}', 10279);

VALUES ('Remote Monitoring of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Using Digital Health Technologies', 'Current care and research pathways for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) primarily rely on regularly scheduled visits to specialized centers. These visits provide intermittent clinical information to health care professionals and require patients to travel to the clinic. Digital health technologies enable continuous data collection directly from the patient''s home, bringing new opportunities for personalized, timely care and a refined assessment of disease severity in clinical trials. In this review, we summarize the state of the art in digital health technologies for remote monitoring of patients with ALS, ranging from televisits through videoconferencing to sensor-based wearable devices. We explore how these technologies can benefit clinical care and advance treatment development. Despite significant progress, real-world adoption of these technologies remains limited. An overview is provided of the key barriers hindering their widespread implementation and the opportunities to advance the field. Significantly, there is an urgent need for harmonization across stakeholders through consensus guidelines and consortia. These efforts are essential to accelerate progress and harness the full potential of digital health technologies to better meet the needs of patients. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by its highly heterogeneous presentation of phenotypes and progression rates. Digital health technology (DHT) may overcome these challenges and improve care delivery. DHT is “a system that uses computing platforms, connectivity, software, and/or sensors, for health care and related uses,” Navigating DHTs from inception to adoption can, however, be a complex and demanding journey, the evidence to support their use in practice being still in its infancy. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies that implemented DHTs in ALS. In August 2024, we searched the PubMed database using search terms including “amyotrophic lateral sclerosis” or “motor neuron disease” combined with various terms to describe DHT. Studies were eligible if they met the following criteria: (1) enrolled at least 10 patients with ALS and (2) investigated a DHT to remotely monitor patients. Studies that solely evaluated a DHT in an in-clinic setting were excluded. We refer to eAppendix 1 (eTable 1 and eFigure 1) for a detailed description of our search strategy and screening procedure. In total, we screened 1,675 citations, of which 77 studies are identified and summarized in  The number of studies that investigated digital health technologies to remotely monitor patients with ALS, categorized into televisiting, self-administered online surveys, objective tools, and telehealth platforms (A). An overview of the tools used for objective measuring (B) and their outcomes (C). For illustrative purposes, no more than 30 outcomes per category were depicted. ALS = amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; DTW = dynamic time warping; EIM = electrical impedance myography. Created in BioRender. van Unnik J (2025)  Although televisits have long been part of routine care, the pandemic led to a tremendous global uptake, resulting in a plethora of reports on how clinical visits could be decentralized. Televisits allow the health care provider to collect and act on synchronous information through a “live” connection to assess the patient''s health status. Although the phone could be used to assess the patient''s health status, for example, by phone-administered ALS Functional Rating Scale–Revised (ALSFRS-R), Only 1 retrospective study was identified that investigated the safety and quality of televisits Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) have emerged as important remote measurement tools, offering a low-burden method to monitor symptoms, daily function, and quality of life, without the need for evaluator training. The self-administered versions of the ALSFRS-R were most frequently investigated and used either a smartphone application or web portal. The surveys were developed in 4 different languages and compared against an evaluator-administered ALSFRS-R, either in-person, by telephone, or by video call. While excellent inter-rater and intra-rater reliability were consistently reported, several studies demonstrated a small positive bias with patients reporting higher scores compared with trained evaluators. In addition, the self-reported Patient-Ranked Order of Function (PROOF) was developed to reflect that patients might perceive some ALSFRS-R domains to be more important than others. PROOF weighs the domains according to a self-reported order of importance, demonstrating excellent test-retest reliability and potential refinement of the ALSFRS-R total score. Remote monitoring of bulbar symptoms typically involves the measurement of speech by eliciting specific tasks using a smartphone application or a web-based platform. Initially, these technologies only acquired voice samples, but more recent applications also allow for video recordings of the facial musculature, thereby enabling a multimodal assessment including acoustic, linguistic, and orofacial characteristics. Elicitation methods were largely similar between studies, although the total number of tasks varied substantially. Frequent tasks included reading passage (short story), diadochokinesis task (quick repetition of sequel of syllables), reading speech (structured sentences), and picture description. Outcomes derived from voice samples typically outperformed those based on video recordings in distinguishing abnormal from normal ALSFRS-R speech scores. Significantly, no study thoroughly investigated patient acceptability or burden of remote speech function assessment. Considerable attrition rates were reported occasionally, questioning the feasibility of long-term monitoring, particularly in later stages of the disease. While many studies reported slope differences between patients with and without bulbar involvement as measured by novel outcomes, longitudinal relationships of these outcomes with current clinical standards, including functional, disability, and survival outcomes, were rarely investigated, highlighting the need for additional validation steps. In addition, the influence of cognitive decline on measured speech outcomes remains to be elucidated as it could affect outcomes derived from both structured and unstructured elicitation methods. Although muscle weakness is the hallmark of ALS and has been widely used as an outcome in clinical trials, remote monitoring of muscle strength has received relatively little attention. Studies have used portable devices with integrated dynamometers to monitor hand grip Electrical impedance myography (EIM) offers a potential alternative to traditional muscle strength assessment, which may be suitable for remote monitoring because of the portability of the device and relatively low measurement complexity. Remote monitoring of physical mobility has commonly been conducted using commercially available or research-graded wearables equipped with an accelerometer. These body-worn devices may collect data passively during everyday life or actively during tasks evoking specific movements. Nearly all studies derived outcomes from passively collected data. These outcomes reflected various constructs, ranging from what a patient can do (capacity) to what the patient actually does in day-to-day life (performance). An overview of the outcomes and their relations with ALS functional measures is illustrated in  Mobility outcomes were grouped into main categories (e.g., “calories” and “metabolic equivalent of task” were grouped under “energy expenditure”) and stratified by either fine or gross motor function (dark green headings) to demonstrate their associations with key ALS outcomes (gray headings). Although a wide variety of mobility outcomes, devices, and wear locations were investigated, most studies solely explored the relationship with the ALSFRS-R using limited sample sizes. The relationship with other key ALS outcomes remains to be quantified, illustrating that additional validation beyond proof-of-concept is warranted before widescale implementation is possible. ALS = amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; ALSFRS-R = ALS Functional Rating Scale–Revised; A = ankle; C = chest; H = hip; S = smartphone; W = wrist. Remote monitoring and adjustment of ventilator oxygen flow is one of the earliest applications of DHTs in ALS. No studies have investigated the feasibility and validity of these assessments in patients with advanced bulbar involvement, which remains a significant unresolved challenge. In addition, while some studies have demonstrated that these technologies may lead to a more rapid prescription of noninvasive ventilation Autonomic dysfunction has been observed in patients with ALS, potentially leading to changes in cardiac function. Heart rate and blood pressure have been found to be predictive for future ALSFRS-R scores. In summary of the above, patients and health care professionals may thus benefit substantially from DHTs, which could positively affect the delivery of care. The reality is, however, that the evidence of most technologies has not yet matured sufficiently and the care provision of today largely continues with traditional periodic visits. Beyond clear evidence of clinical benefit of DHT, successful integration of these technologies in existing pathways is critical for their adoption. Leah, a 62-year-old woman, received the ALS diagnosis 2 years ago. Since first symptom onset, she has been coping with the relentless progression of the disease. A few months ago, she experienced some shortness of breath while performing activities, which is perhaps the reason why she joined a pilot program to monitor her respiratory function at home that supplemented usual care. Since then, Leah has been self-assessing her vital capacity using home-based spirometry and monitoring for orthopnea using a self-administered survey. Data were communicated to the ALS center through a telehealth platform that is accessible on her smartphone. After 6 months, her vital capacity declined and Leah messaged through the telehealth platform that she started to have trouble breathing during the night. She was promptly referred to a pulmonologist, and NIV was initiated shortly thereafter. ALS = amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; NIV = noninvasive ventilation. Although pilot programs have affirmed the wielding capabilities of telehealth platforms to potentially benefit current ALS care, these studies have also exposed several challenges to translating their promise into practice. Fostering interoperability to allow seamless dataflows between DHTs, electronic health care systems, and patient portals is a vital task While DHTs have been linked to potential cost reductions, As evidence of DHTs continues to mature, the uptake of these technologies is likely to spread and diversify beyond the occasional use of televisits. Telehealth platforms combined with DHT-derived outcomes offer health care providers insights into the health status of patients that extend far beyond the current model, facilitating more personalized, timely care. Moreover, the growing amount of data collected from future observational studies will bring new opportunities to further enhance clinical decision making, for example, by developing models using accelerometry data that predict the time to wheelchair dependency or loss of ambulation. Despite the enormous interest for DHTs in clinical drug development, their implementation remains limited to only a few clinical trials (e.g.,  Instead, a more comprehensive approach is required. In the near future, digital outcomes could support measures such as neurofilament levels and electrophysiologic markers to capture early treatment signals and refine phase 2 to 3 decision making. At some time in the future, one might imagine DHT-derived outcomes replacing their respective ALSFRS-R subdomain counterparts, allowing for objective, detailed, and remotely collected outcome measures that can be tested in hierarchical order to demonstrate efficacy in clinical trials. Alternatively, one could combine these different measures—both clinically and statistically—into a single, composite end point to reflect the overall response to treatment. To establish how best to undertake this approach would be an interesting challenge. Such a digital surrogate—combined with definite end points such as survival—allows for data flow optimization to enhance operational efficiencies. In summary, the field has grown significantly in recent years, resulting in a vast array of technologies to monitor patients, as highlighted by this review. Although some variety in technological solutions is essential to encompass all aspects affected by ALS, much of the research has focused on developing new outcomes while targeting the same disease aspect. This has yielded an abundance of small, proof-of-concept studies with limited evidence to support their use in real-world practice. At the same time, there are several disease aspects that have received limited attention despite being perceived as important by patients, such as fatigue and cognition. A collaborative approach, with the development of consensus guidelines and standards, streamlines the generation of evidence required to support DHTs in real-world practices, encompassing proof of validity, reliability, clinical relevance, and clinical benefit. In addition, there is an unrealized opportunity to increase the value of DHT-generated data, which, at present, are typically isolated from the broader research community. Opt-in clauses for data sharing, without compromising patient privacy, incorporated in new and existing protocols could enable data aggregation in digital registries and large international databases, similar to current efforts aimed at unraveling the genetic basis of ALS. Several initiatives are already underway, such as the ALS Research Collaborative and PRECISION ALS, As the regulatory and reimbursement landscape continues to evolve, alternative pathways may become increasingly accessible to alleviate current challenges in generating evidence of cost-effectiveness for digital technologies, for example, by using flexible reimbursement models and collection of real-world data. Although most DHTs were deemed feasible and well tolerated by patients, follow-up durations were limited and the suitability of these technologies to monitor patients during more advanced disease stages or increasing cognitive impairment remains largely unproven. Moreover, special attention should be aimed at engaging diverse and lower digitally literate patients to increase accessibility and prevent exacerbating existing health disparities, Still, the uptake of DHTs may largely depend on their successful integration in existing research and care pathways. While the pharmaceutical industry could lead the effort by adopting DHTs as explanatory end points in clinical trials, implementing these technologies in routine care may be more complicated, in part because of the required reimbursement by health insurance companies and interoperability with existing infrastructure. Nevertheless, while significant challenges remain unsolved, the adoption and coverage of DHTs to remotely monitor patients have been steadily increasing, allowing us a glimpse into the future on how these technologies may better serve the needs of patients. These knowledge gaps and challenges hindering the uptake of DHTs in the clinical practice of today, and the potential solutions to facilitate their use in the care and research of tomorrow, are summarized in  Current Knowledge Gaps, Challenges, and Potential Steps Toward Increased Use of Digital Health Technologies in Real-World Practice Abbreviations: ALS = amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; ALSFRS-R = ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised; DHT = digital health technology. In conclusion, the use of DHTs has the potential to reshape our care and research pathways. This transition has, to date, not yet fully transpired, and only a few technologies are being used in selected settings, while the provision of care largely continues with regular, in-clinic visits. This is mainly driven by uncertain cost-benefit assessments, limiting perpetual use of DHTs beyond the initial pilot or outside a research context. For drug development, none of the outcomes derived from DHTs has been comprehensively validated and their added value in capturing clinical meaningful information is largely unknown. Given the limited evidence to date, the possibility also remains that these technologies are ineffective and add unnecessary burden, complexity, and expense. Nevertheless, seeking harmonization among all stakeholders through consensus guidelines and consortia is required to fully realize the potential of DHTs to better meet the needs of patients living with this devastating disease.', 'PubMed_Central', 'mental_health_treatment', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/', 'research_article', '{"content_hash": "58f4173ce9d66480", "embedding_date": "2025-06-25T14:21:11.412229", "scraper_source": "PubMed_Central", "category": "research_literature", "subcategory": "pubmed_central", "document_type": "research_article", "published_date": "", "original_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/"}', 16954);

VALUES ('The Relationship Between Social Media Use Purposes, Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors, and Metabolic Parameters in Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes', 'Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic disease characterized by insufficient insulin production, typically occurring during childhood or adolescence. This condition can directly affect many metabolic parameters and healthy lifestyle behaviors that impact an individual''s quality of life [ Social media, in addition to being a tool that enhances social interactions among young people, also plays a significant role in acquiring and sharing health information. It has been determined that the level of trust in social media has a meaningful and positive effect on acquiring health information in digital environments [ However, it is believed that social media use is not limited to information acquisition, but can also affect individuals'' lifestyles and health behaviors. A study conducted by Hygen et al. [ The purposes of social media use in adolescents with T1D emerge as an important factor in health management. The NutriWalking app, developed by Hartzler et al. [ Consequently, the relationship between the purposes of social media use and healthy lifestyle behaviors and metabolic parameters in adolescents with T1D is a complex issue that requires a multidisciplinary approach. Social media is considered an important tool for adolescents in acquiring health information, establishing social interactions, and developing healthy lifestyle behaviors. Therefore, increasing research in this area will allow us to better understand the relationships between social media use and diabetes management in adolescents. Additionally, it is crucial for pediatric nurses, within their roles in protecting and promoting child health, to identify potential issues and plan nursing interventions. These nurses not only treat diseases but also take on the responsibility of protecting children''s physical and mental health by promoting healthy lifestyles. In this context, identifying the relationship between the purposes of social media use, healthy lifestyle behaviors, and metabolic parameters in adolescents with T1D will shed light on diabetes management for nurses, parents, and adolescents. This research is designed as a descriptive and cross-sectional study to determine the relationship between the purposes of social media use, healthy lifestyle behaviors, and metabolic parameters in adolescents with T1D. The study used purposive sampling method. Adolescents who were aged between 11 and 18 years, were diagnosed with T1D mellitus and were residing in Gaziantep were included in the study. Adolescents who submitted incomplete and incorrect data (13 people) were excluded from the study. The informed consent form for the research was electronically sent to the adolescents and their parents via a Google Forms link, and their consent was obtained. The researchers distributed the questionnaire and the scales, prepared on the electronic environment, to social media (WhatsApp) groups of the adolescents who agreed to participate in the study between 1 and 30 September 2023. The adolescents were asked to voluntarily complete the questionnaire forms. A post-power analysis was done to calculate the sample size. A power of 99% and an effect size of 0.4 were calculated. Based on the post hoc analysis, it was determined that the sample size ( An adolescent descriptive information form, the Scale of Social Media Use Purposes (SSMUP), the Social Media Addiction Scale (SMAS), and the Adolescent Lifestyle Profile (ALP) were used as data collection tools in the study. This is a 15-item form prepared by the researchers upon literature review [ The scale developed by Solmaz et al.

The data were analyzed using descriptive data such as number, percentage, mean and standard deviation (SD), and statistical methods such as  The approval was obtained from university ethics committee (Decision No. 2023-30 dated 01/08/2023) in order to conduct the study. The adolescents and parents who participated in the study were informed about the purpose and process of the study through the Google Form. The researcher obtained the authors'' permission via e-mail to use the scales. No personal data was collected in the Google Form. This section of the study will analyze the findings obtained from 108 adolescents diagnosed with T1D mellitus who were voluntary to participate in the study. It was determined that 58.3% of the adolescents were female, 88.9% had a nuclear family, 65.7% were in their early adolescence period, 50.9% had a family income less than expenses, and 25% had problems with their parents ( In the study it was found that 23.1% of adolescents used the information they learned from social media to treat their diabetes. The social media platforms on which they learned information were Instagram (59.3%), YouTube (38.9%), and WhatsApp (28.7%), respectively. A total of 49.1% of the adolescents spent 121 min and more on social media daily ( 
 
 A significant relationship was found between social media addiction and HbA1c levels, one of the metabolic parameters of adolescents ( This study was conducted to examine the relationship between the purposes of social media use, healthy lifestyle behaviors, and metabolic parameters in adolescents with T1D. It was observed that there was a positive and significant correlation between social media addiction and social media use purposes. This suggests that social media use purposes lay the groundwork for social media addiction. Individuals use social media platforms for many purposes, including communication with others, accessing news, browsing the internet, preparing for educational activities, seeking information related to their treatments, and engaging in leisure activities [ A significant negative correlation was observed between social media addiction and interpersonal relationships. Social media addiction impairs face-to-face communication skills negatively [ It is observed that there is a significant positive relationship between the purposes of social media use and physical activity. It facilitates self-management of behaviors related to physical activity and quality of life in adolescents who use social media to get information about exercises [ A significant positive correlation was observed between social media use and a healthy diet. Access to information about nutrition quality on social media appears to facilitate the regulation of behaviors associated with diet quality [ A significant positive correlation was observed between social media use purposes and interpersonal relationships. Adolescents use social media in interpersonal interactions. Older adolescents use social media to communicate and interact with others more than their younger counterparts. As the internet and social media use of adolescents rises, their use of social media for interpersonal interactions and their social media addiction also increases [ It is observed that social media addiction has a significant relationship with HbA1c values and fasting blood glucose levels. It has been reported that adolescents change their treatment routine and cause poor glycaemic control as they spend time on internet browsing, video gaming, and social media platforms until midnight [ There are some factors that impose limitations on the generalizability of the findings presented herein. First, the data were collected via Google Forms rather than face-to-face interviews. Second, we lack information regarding adolescents who refused to participate in the questionnaire. Moreover, since the study was conducted in a single province, it may not be possible to generalize the results to a wider population. As a result of the research, it was found that interpersonal relationships are negatively associated with social media addiction. The purposes of social media use were positively associated with physical activity, healthy eating, and interpersonal relationships. It was also determined that social media addiction has a negative relationship with the metabolic parameters (HbA1c values and fasting blood glucose levels) of adolescents with T1D. Social media use purposes affect healthy lifestyles. Creating social media content suitable for managing diabetes in adolescents with T1D mellitus (T1DM) and organizing trainings on the positive and negative effects of social media use by pediatric nurses can provide adolescents with access to correct health information and achieve optimal metabolic parameters. The study suggests that adolescents with social media addiction may suffer from interpersonal communication problems. Close follow-up of social media use and interpersonal communication in adolescents who are socially isolated due to chronic illness and early intervention in possible deviations by nurses can protect and improve their health.

VALUES ('The Effectiveness of Low-Level LED Light Therapy for Sleep Problems, Psychological Symptoms, and Heart Rate Variability in Shift-Work Nurses: A Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Nursing involves 24-h continuous patient care, requiring shift work. Shift-work nurses need to adapt to frequently changing circadian rhythms, which cause sleep disturbances and affect hormone secretion and regulation. Shift work increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, dysautonomia, digestive diseases, metabolic syndrome, and obesity, endangering the physical and psychological health of nurses [ Among nurses, shift work is not only related to sleep disturbance but also to psychological symptoms, job stress, and family care responsibilities [ Low-level light therapy (LLLT) can produce a photobiomodulation (PBM) effect using red light (630–700 nm) and near-red light (700–1100 nm) to irradiate the human body. The proposed mechanism is that photons dissociate inhibitory nitric oxide from enzymes, leading to an increase in electron transport, mitochondrial membrane potential, and ATP production. Another proposed mechanism concerns the activation of light-sensitive ion channels, allowing calcium to enter the cell. After the initial photon absorption events, numerous signaling pathways are activated through reactive oxygen species, cyclic AMP, NO, and Ca One study recruited participants with general anxiety who were asked to self-administer 830 nm light therapy for 20 min a day for 8 weeks; the results showed a significant improvement in anxiety scores and sleep quality [ Shift-work nurses show sleep difficulty and psychological symptoms, which may be associated with changing circadian rhythms.

The study participants were shift-work nurses working in a medical center in Taipei, Taiwan, recruited from July 2021 to June 2022. The inclusion criteria were nurses who participated in a 4-week shift work schedule in the last 6 months and had self-reported insomnia with Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores ≥ 9. We excluded those with a history of head surgery and who were pregnant. The study participants were recruited through posters, line groups, and the first author''s personal network in the study hospital. The eligible participants were informed of the study''s purpose and that participation in the study involved committing themselves to 12 measurements in the 4-week study period. All participants signed a written consent form. Block randomization with a block size of four was used to randomize the study participants into intervention or control groups. Combinations of the assignments were placed in six opaque envelopes. The study participants were given a serial number. Before study initiation, a researcher unsealed the envelopes and assigned participants accordingly. The required sample size was estimated by G Power 3.1 based on repeated measures with an effect size of 0.2, Type 1 error of 0.05, and power of 0.8, resulting in a required sample size of 42. Since this study involved multiple measures, to account for expected attrition, we aimed to recruit at least 30 participants per group. In total, 64 participants were recruited, with 32 in the intervention group and 32 in the control group. As participants were informed of the commitment needed for participation, all participants completed the study. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Taipei Veterans General Hospital (IRB no. 2021-06-010C). A portable Meridian Aura Cap (MAC) (I-Tai, Ministry of Health Medical Devices No. 005077; Top Union Globaltek INC, Hsinchu City, Taiwan) equipped with low-level LED light was used to provide red and near-infrared light (660 and 850 nm) irradiation for 30 min, three times a week for 4 weeks. The MAC was designed using eight soft bands and an optical power maximum of 10 W. Irradiation sites covered the meridians and head acupoints: Baihui (GV20), Shentíng (GV24), Touwei (ST8), Jiaosun (SJ20), Fengchi (GB 20), and Fengfu (DU16). The invention patent number is I702067 (Republic of China, Taiwan). The control group did not receive any intervention. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and ANSWatch TS0411 (Taiwan Scientific, Xīndiàn, New Taipei, Taiwan). HRV was measured using the ANSWatch. Background variables included sociodemographics (age, sex, educational level, marital status, and children at home), work status (work unit, work years, and shift-work status in the last month and the current month), and use of hypnotics. Background variables were measured at baseline. Psychological symptoms were measured at baseline and every week after the three sessions were completed. Insomnia was measured at baseline and every 2 weeks thereafter. Psychological symptoms were measured using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) [ Sleep problems were measured using the ISI [ Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 28.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). Characteristics by intervention or control group were examined using the  The baseline characteristics of the intervention and control groups are presented in  Tables  In  As significant differences in age and probable differences in preintervention psychological state were found between the intervention and control groups, GEE was used to yield age- and preintervention psychological state-adjusted effects ( The results of HRV indicators, including arrhythmia, HRV, and LF/HF, did not differ significantly between the intervention and control groups after the 4-week LLLT. Approximately 30% of study nurses had arrhythmia pretests (31% for both groups). After completion of the 4-week LLLT, the proportion of study nurses with arrhythmia was 28% in the intervention group and 37% in the control group ( Approximately 66% of study nurses had dysautonomia pretest (control group: 63%, intervention group: 69%). After completion of the 4-week LLLT, the proportion of study nurses with dysautonomia was 72% in the intervention group and 75% in the control group ( This study found that LLLT intervention three times a week for 4 weeks was effective in treating insomnia, depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms among shift-work nurses with self-reported insomnia. The study nurses were on a 1-month fixed shift (the same shift schedule in a month); as a result, the intervention time was set at 4 weeks to decrease the effect of the transition between day, evening, and night work. The light waves, source, irradiation times, and duration differ across previous studies, limiting the comparability with the current study. Despite this, the present study agreed with previous studies in showing the effectiveness of LLLT in improving sleep problems and psychological symptoms [ The full mechanisms of LLLT remain under investigation. Nevertheless, transcranial PBM using red or near-infrared light can penetrate the skull, enhance cytochrome c oxidase activity, and boost mitochondrial metabolism [ The LLLT intervention was not effective in altering HRV indicators, though the prevalence of arrhythmia was 31% preintervention and 28% postintervention. The prevalence of dysautonomia was 69% preintervention and 72% postintervention. Prior research suggests that shift work is related to circadian rhythm irregularity that can lead to cardiac dysautonomia [ Past studies have shown that nurses'' shift work and circadian rhythm disorders affect heart rhythm variability and cause abnormal indicators [ Due to their work characteristics, job stress, and shift-work schedules, nurses have a high risk of psychological stress and chronic diseases [ Though we used random assignment, the intervention group was significantly younger than the control group. Besides, the intervention group showed lower pretest scores in depression, anxiety, and stress, though not statistically significant. Therefore, we applied GEE to adjust for age and preintervention states. The study nurses were from a single medical center, and the sample size was small. Future studies with a heterogeneous population and larger sample sizes are needed. The shift work in this study was based on a fixed and regular 8-h shift. Further studies are also needed to examine and compare LLLT''s effectiveness across different shift-work schedules and patterns. LLLT three times a week for 4 weeks improved sleep quality in shift-work nurses with insomnia and alleviated depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms; however, it did not improve HRV. This is a single-center study with a relatively small sample size, while the results are promising, studies with larger sample sizes and at different hospital settings are needed to further evaluate the effects before recommending widespread implementation.', 'PubMed_Central', 'mental_health_treatment', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/', 'research_article', '{"content_hash": "0b168d610638397c", "embedding_date": "2025-06-25T14:21:13.582851", "scraper_source": "PubMed_Central", "category": "research_literature", "subcategory": "pubmed_central", "document_type": "research_article", "published_date": "", "original_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/"}', 8713);

VALUES ('Psoriasis: an update on topical and systemic therapies', 'Psoriasis is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease with a genetic predisposition. Although manifesting predominantly as a hyperproliferative skin disorder, psoriasis is a systemic disease associated with a range of comorbidities including arthritis, cardiovascular disease and depression. Educating the patient that psoriasis is chronic and that there are possible comorbidities is paramount. Patients with a limited number of plaques and no systemic symptoms may be managed with intermittent use of topical therapies. Those with more extensive or debilitating disease may require phototherapy or systemic medicines such as methotrexate or one of the newer targeted therapies. Newer systemic therapies, including oral medicines and injectable biologics, can only be used following unsuccessful treatment with traditional therapies such as methotrexate and phototherapy. Biologic therapies for psoriasis offer the possibility of near-complete symptom resolution in people with psoriatic disease. Psoriasis is a multisystem immune-mediated inflammatory disease. It manifests predominantly as a hyperproliferative papulosquamous skin disorder, but is associated with a range of comorbidities, such as psoriatic arthritis and cardiovascular disease. The physician-diagnosed prevalence of psoriasis in adults in Australia is estimated at around 2.4%. Psoriasis can have a large impact on quality of life, with 75% of patients reporting alterations in daily activities, difficulties with body image and self-esteem, and feelings of stigma, shame and embarrassment. Psoriasis has a multi-factorial inheritance, The onset of psoriasis has 2 peaks: at age 15 to 20 years (more common in females), and over the age of 40 (equal sex distribution). Diagnosis of psoriasis is almost always clinical. Biopsy is not recommended in most cases. Typical psoriatic lesions have been classically described as well-circumscribed, salmon-pink plaques with a loosely adherent scale. The plaques are usually symmetrical and often occur on areas of skin trauma such as elbows and knees (Koebner phenomenon). They are generally not itchy, but pruritus (itch) can be prominent particularly in older patients. Children may present with thick plaques with dense scale in the scalp (pityriasis amiantacea). Teenage patients often present with widespread, truncal, pink plaques which may be itchy (guttate psoriasis) following streptococcal pharyngitis. Older adults may present with widespread erythema and sometimes minimal scale (erythrodermic psoriasis). The multiple presentations of psoriasis can make the diagnosis difficult and often other clues are sought including nail changes, such as pitting and separation of the nail from its nail bed (onycholysis), thick skin in weight-bearing areas, stubborn dandruff and family history of psoriasis. The differential diagnoses for similar well-circumscribed scaly plaques include skin cancer (Bowen disease), eczematous patches, dermatophyte infection, cutaneous lupus erythematosus and mycosis fungoides. The wide differential and variable morphology of psoriasis mean that it is often misdiagnosed. There are Australian consensus criteria for the assessment of psoriasis severity and determining suitability for systemic therapy ( Moderate to severe psoriasis is disease that cannot be adequately managed with topical therapy alone and requires phototherapy or systemic therapy. Patients may be candidates for systemic therapy if they meet at least one of the following criteria: body surface area affected is more than 10% Psoriasis Area of Severity Index (PASI) is more than 10 Physician Global Assessment (PGA) is more than 2 (scale of 0 to 4) Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is more than 10 psoriatic disease involves high-impact areas (face, nails, genitalia, scalp, palmoplantar [hands or feet] and intertriginous skin) [NB1] severe pruritus leading to excoriation failure of topical therapy. NB1: Validated tools for assessing disease severity at specific high-impact sites are available; these may be useful when disease is localised. Psoriasis is a systemic disease and is associated with a range of significant comorbidities. Moderate and severe psoriasis have also been associated with excess mortality. Specific comorbidities are part of the psoriatic disease; these include arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and uveitis. Up to 40% of patients with psoriasis may have some form of joint involvement. Severe psoriasis is associated with nonspecific comorbidities such as metabolic syndrome and obesity. Psoriasis is an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction and stroke. Patients with psoriasis have higher rates of mental illness, substance abuse and self-harm, and higher likelihood of suicidal ideation, attempts and completion. Because psoriasis is a systemic disease that may affect, for example, joints, bowel and eyes, systemic therapy may be required. Management of the skin disease using topical agents reduces the symptoms (itch, scale) and the impact of skin symptoms on quality of life, but does not treat the systemic disease. Also, topical therapies can be hard to use, messy and have relatively poor compliance. Patients with a limited number of plaques and no systemic symptoms may be managed with intermittent use of topical therapies. Patients with moderate to severe psoriasis with features such as skin disease affecting more than 10% of body surface, pustular psoriasis, erythroderma, recalcitrant plaques or disease with significant impact on quality of life (e.g. interfering with function) ( Systemic corticosteroids (e.g. oral prednisolone) must be avoided as a rapid reduction of dose can precipitate catastrophic pustular psoriasis, a potentially life-threatening medical emergency. Educating the patient that psoriasis is chronic and that there are possible comorbidities is paramount. Patients can be reassured that the rash is not contagious, and that steps can be taken to reduce flares such as reducing alcohol intake, stopping smoking and optimising diet. Initial management of mild to moderate psoriasis typically involves the use of topical treatments, such as emollients, corticosteroids, calcipotriol, tar and dithranol. There is little evidence to guide the selection of topical treatments, so it can be based on patient and prescriber preference. Regular (at least once daily) use of a fragrance-free moisturiser, particularly on thick plaques of elbows, knees and the sacral area, can reduce the scale and discomfort associated with cracking skin. Emollients can be supplemented with keratolytics such as urea (10%) or salicylic acid (up to 6%) with a thick cream base or white soft paraffin. Stronger keratolytics (e.g. urea 25%, salicylic acid greater than 8%) are useful on the thick skin of palms and soles but can be painful on raw or open skin. Topical corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory action and reduce the scale and hyperproliferation of the skin. Although topical corticosteroids are effective at reducing the erythema and scale, prolonged use will cause tachyphylaxis (less efficacy) over time, extension of the area of disease and flare after stopping. Hence, they should be used only for a short time (e.g. 2 to 3 weeks) and/or intermittently (e.g. weekends). Low-potency corticosteroids (e.g. methylprednisolone aceponate or hydrocortisone 1%) can be used on the face and genital areas. More potent topical corticosteroids (e.g. mometasone furoate, betamethasone dipropionate) are needed for thick plaques on the scalp, elbows and knees, and palms and soles. Topical calcipotriol, a vitamin D analogue, is antiproliferative and reduces the size of psoriatic plaques. It can be irritant and should be avoided on the face, flexural areas and groin. Excessive use (more than 100 g per week) can increase the risk of hypercalcaemia. Calcipotriol is only available on the PBS as a combination product with a potent topical corticosteroid; due to the steroid component, this should only be used short term or intermittently. Tar and dithranol are traditional topical therapies that can be cost-effective but have fallen out of favour because they are messy and odorous. Liquid coal tar ( Dithranol (1%) ointment can be applied to thick plaques and washed off after 10 to 30 minutes (short-contact dithranol therapy). It can stain skin and light-coloured hair. Management options for moderate to severe psoriasis include: phototherapy (narrowband UVB) older oral medicines (methotrexate, acitretin and cyclosporin) newer oral medicines (apremilast, deucravacitinib) injectable biologic medicines (tumour necrosis factor [TNF] alpha inhibitors, and anti-interleukin [IL]-17, anti-IL-23, and anti-IL-12 and 23 therapies). There is little evidence to inform the order of treatment selection; however, the newer oral medicines and injectable biologic medicines require prior unsuccessful treatment with older therapies such as methotrexate and/or phototherapy, and consultation with a dermatologist, rheumatologist or general physician to obtain PBS subsidy (

NB2: There are no PBS restrictions on who can prescribe acitretin, but state and territory regulations, and medical indemnity considerations, may limit who can initiate this drug. NB3: Categories of specialist physician that can initiate biologic drugs varies by drug and indication. Refer to the PBS Schedule for details. It may be reasonable to start treatment with oral methotrexate in primary care if there will be a long delay (e.g. more than 3 months) in accessing a dermatologist or other specialist who can prescribe newer therapies. Narrowband UVB (wavelength 311 to 312 nm) is effective at clearing most thin plaques of psoriasis in 80% of patients. The patient stands in a treatment box with shielded eyes or face for up to 15 minutes at a time. Treatment requires 3 days per week therapy over several weeks. Downsides of phototherapy are the time commitment, potential increased risk of skin cancer and premature ageing. Oral methotrexate, generally 10 to 20 mg once weekly with a folic acid supplement, has been shown to improve psoriasis in about 60% of patients. With regular monitoring of blood count, liver function and kidney function, it is relatively safe and effective. Methotrexate is a folate antagonist and is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy. It is passed on in breast milk, and it affects spermatogenesis. Methotrexate has many potential side effects, including gastrointestinal upset, mouth ulceration, and bone marrow suppression. It can be hepatotoxic, particularly in psoriatic patients with metabolic syndrome and associated steatotic liver disease. Permanent liver cirrhosis can occur with prolonged use and high cumulative doses. Clinicians need to be aware that this is not a set-and-forget treatment; it requires ongoing monitoring. Acitretin is an orally administered retinoid that has some efficacy in palmoplantar psoriasis and erythrodermic psoriasis. At psoriatic effective doses, there are significant side effects including dryness of lips, eyes and skin with peeling palms and soles. There is often diffuse hair loss, especially in older women. It can cause impaired liver function; concomitant alcohol use is discouraged. It usually increases serum lipids. It is teratogenic and should not be used in women of childbearing age. Patients cannot donate blood for up to 3 years after stopping treatment as the drug and teratogenic metabolites can remain long term. State or territory health department authorisation may be required before prescribing acitretin. Acitretin can be used in conjunction with phototherapy where it can enhance therapy especially in thick plaques. Cyclosporin is a calcineurin inhibitor that is immunosuppressive. It has a limited role because it invariably causes renal impairment and hypertension with prolonged use, and psoriasis flares rapidly on stopping. Cyclosporin is, however, very effective in rapidly clearing disease and can be used as a rescue treatment in patients with pustular or widespread disease while starting other agents with slower onset of action but better long-term safety. Monitoring of blood pressure and renal function is essential. It can be effective in treating acute psoriatic arthritis. Apremilast is an oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor with efficacy in both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. The advent of injectable biologic therapies for psoriasis has resulted in the possibility of nearly disease-free activity, with very high efficacy in treatment of psoriatic disease. In clinical trials there were also reductions in depression and anxiety scores, Biologic therapies are very costly and use in Australia is restricted to patients with PASI over 15, or more than 30% disease on face, palms and soles, as well as failure of 2 systemic therapies of at least 6 weeks duration each. TNF alpha inhibitors (etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab and their biosimilars) are rarely used today as first-line therapies due to the availability of more effective drugs with higher psoriasis clearance rates and longer persistence of effect. However, they are often utilised in inpatient treatment for severe pustular psoriasis due to their rapidity of action. TNF alpha inhibitors are contraindicated in patients with active infections including tuberculosis, and have a higher rate of infection than the other biologic agents. They may worsen congestive cardiac failure. Although effective in clearing skin disease (up to 45% in infliximab), most patients show loss of efficacy over 2 to 3 years. Anti-IL-17 therapies (bimekizumab, ixekizumab, secukinumab), anti-IL-23 therapies (guselkumab, risankizumab, tildrakizumab) and anti-IL-12 and 23 therapies (ustekinumab) show strong efficacy (up to 88% patients with near-complete skin clearance) and long persistence. Anti-IL-17 therapies have slightly higher rates of infection, particularly oral thrush, but have demonstrated better efficacy on joints, compared with anti-IL-23 therapies. Anti-IL-17 therapies are contraindicated in inflammatory bowel disease as they may catastrophically flare active disease. Anti-IL-23 and anti-IL-12 and 23 therapies have few side effects (injection-site reaction is most common). They have some efficacy especially in peripheral psoriatic arthritis, and in higher doses are effective in inflammatory bowel disease. Psoriasis is a common multisystem inflammatory disease that has profound impact on patients. Although skin disease is the most common presentation, effective management of psoriasis requires identification and management of associated comorbidities. Topical therapies are useful in reducing the skin symptoms. Systemic treatments, including new biologic medicines, treat both skin and systemic disease.', 'PubMed_Central', 'mental_health_treatment', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/', 'research_article', '{"content_hash": "d2b1fe7ac334efba", "embedding_date": "2025-06-25T14:21:14.383036", "scraper_source": "PubMed_Central", "category": "research_literature", "subcategory": "pubmed_central", "document_type": "research_article", "published_date": "", "original_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/"}', 15253);

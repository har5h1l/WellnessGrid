Carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars, primarily glucose. Glucose is a critically important source of energy for the body''s cells. To provide energy to the cells, glucose needs to leave the blood and get inside the cells. The hormone insulin produced by the pancreas and released into the bloodstream signals the body''s cells to take up glucose. When levels of glucose in the blood rise, like following a meal, the pancreas normally produces more insulin. Type 1 diabetes occurs when some or all of the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas are destroyed. This leaves the patient with little or no insulin. pe 1 diabetes occurs when some or all of the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas are destroyed. This leaves the patient with little or no insulin. Without insulin, sugar accumulates in the bloodstream rather than entering the cells. As a result, the body cannot use this glucose for energy. In addition, the high levels of glucose that remain in the blood cause excessive urination and dehydration, and damage tissues of the body. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. This means it begins when the body''s immune system attacks cells in the body. In type 1 diabetes, the immune system destroys insulin-producing cells (beta cells) in the pancreas.

In type 1 diabetes, the immune system destroys insulin-producing cells (beta cells) in the pancreas. Type 2 diabetes occurs when your body''s cells resist the normal effect of insulin, which is to drive glucose in the blood into the inside of the cells. This condition is called insulin resistance. As a result, glucose starts to build up in the blood. In people with insulin resistance, the pancreas "sees" the blood glucose level rising. The pancreas responds by making extra insulin to maintain a normal blood sugar level. Over time, the body''s insulin resistance gets worse.

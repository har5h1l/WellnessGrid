This prospective study used data from the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study survey, linked to register information on labor market outcomes and education attainment, to examine the association between tobacco smoking and long-term labor market outcomes (earnings and employment, A one-unit increase in pack-year of smoking was associated with a 1.8% decrease in earnings (95% confidence interval [CI]: −2.6% to −0.9%) and a 0.5% reduction in years employed (95% CI: −0.6% to −0.3%). iated with a 1.8% decrease in earnings (95% confidence interval [CI]: −2.6% to −0.9%) and a 0.5% reduction in years employed (95% CI: −0.6% to −0.3%). This association was pronounced among participants with lower education levels. The earnings difference was evident among younger cohorts, whereas a negative correlation with employment was observed most strongly in older cohorts among individuals with lower education. Our findings suggest that smoking had a negative effect on earnings among the younger generation, particularly among the less well-educated. The finding of greater impacts on years of employment among the older age group, particularly among groups with low education levels, is consistent with the delayed onset of most health impacts, which may particularly affect productivity larly among groups with low education levels, is consistent with the delayed onset of most health impacts, which may particularly affect productivity', 'PubMed_Central', 'smoking cessation', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC', 'research_abstract', 'scientific_literature', '2025-06-26T12:59:49.995541', '82c53dab862c57c88227f17d8bc2b9ed', 0, '2025-06-26T13:08:06.439926', '2025-06-26T13:08:06.439928');

We present a 26-year-old lady, three months post-laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with a complicated postoperative course due to poor oral intake and recurrent vomiting, who presented with bilateral limb weakness and vision loss of five days duration.

She was extensively tested for different disease-causing neuropathies, including lumbar puncture, imaging studies of the brain and spine regions, nerve conduction studies, and autoimmune disorders. Investigations revealed significantly low thiamine levels compared to other vitamins and minerals. She was managed with vitamin supplementation and aggressive physiotherapy.

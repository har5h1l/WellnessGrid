VALUES ('The Epidemiology and Determinants of Opportunistic Intestinal Parasites Among HIV-Positive Patients Attending Care and Treatment Centers in Northcentral Ethiopia', 'Opportunistic intestinal parasites (OIPs), such as coccidian parasites (like  Past research on OIP infections has shown that a range of factors play a role in spreading the infection in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. These include determinants like not keeping sanitary facilities clean, using unsafe water sources, not having enough toilets, not teaching people about how the infection spreads, not following good hygiene habits, not having enough income, and living in overcrowded conditions [ Different researchers reported the prevalence of coccidian parasites in Ethiopia among people with HIV [ In several rural villages within the Debre Tabor district, clean water is scarce, forcing community members to rely on unsafe water sources. This reliance on diverse water sources significantly increases the likelihood of illness from waterborne diseases. Additionally, the levels of environmental sanitation and personal hygiene in these rural villages are notably poor (South Gondar Health Office, personal communication, November 2019). Additionally, there is no information about the coinfection rate of OIPs among patients attending ART. Up-to-date information regarding OIP magnitude and predictors is vital for better treatment and interventions and may support national and international HIV END strategies and eradication programs. Therefore, the study is aimed at estimating the prevalence of OIPs and determining drivers among HIV-positive patients on ART treatment in Debre Tabor General Hospital, Northcentral Ethiopia. A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted between December 2019 and February 2020 at Debre Tabor General Hospital in Debre Tabor town, located in Northcentral Ethiopia. Debre Tabor is a town situated 667 km away from Addis Ababa, elevated at 2706 m above sea level. Serving around 2.3 million individuals, the hospital boasts over 110 beds. The hospital has been providing HIV counseling, testing, treatment, and follow-up services since the 1990s. At the hospital''s ART clinic, 2210 HIV/AIDS patients were actively receiving ART during the study period. The medical records, however, pointed to a greater figure. At Debre Tabor General Hospital, all HIV-positive individuals who registered at the ART clinic were included as a source of the population. All registered HIV/AIDS patients actively attending appointments or follow-up at the ART clinic of the hospital during the study duration were chosen for the research. This study encompassed all individuals with HIV/AIDS who provided written consent to participate and visited ART clinics during the examination period. Only those who expressed a desire to take part in the study were included. Those participants who have been taking antiparasitic medication during the last 3 months were excluded from this study. Also, those severely ill patients who were unable to respond to questions or with a history or diagnosis of acute or chronic disease–causing immune suppression (COVID-19, tuberculosis, asthma, cirrhosis, cancer, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, transplant recipients, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) were excluded from the study. We used a formula to determine the size of the sample ( After adding 10% (38) for contingency, the final sample size was 422 individuals. A systematic random sampling method was employed by calculating the  The study was focused on the following independent variables: sociodemographic status, environmental and personal hygiene, the status of ART adherence, clinical conditions, and the immune status of the patient. The prevalence of OIPs was considered the response variable in the present study. A structured questionnaire was prepared, pretested, and validated before 2 weeks of study at Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital in Bahir Dar on 20 people with HIV to evaluate the quality and strength of the questionnaire. The ART clinician and principal investigators provided a directional view and awareness of the study''s objective to encourage active participation in filling out the questionnaire. The questionnaire was originally prepared in English and then translated to Amharic and back to English to obtain content validity. After modifying and assuring its quality, the pretested questionnaires were administered to respondents to generate data on risk factors of OIPs, such as questions related to sociodemographic characteristics, behavioral habits, hygienic and sanitary conditions, environmental conditions, and clinical information. The recent CD4+ T cell count data was taken from patients'' medical records. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, a specialized form of flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, California, United States), was used to determine the count at the Debre Tabor General Hospital ART clinic. The proper method for the collection of stool samples was provided to ensure the favorable condition of the stool sample. Also, an oral description and specific instructions on proper handling and avoiding contamination of the stool specimen were given to the entire participant by the investigator. Disposable plastic cups with an applicator spoon for the collection of stool samples were provided for study subjects by labeling them with their unique codes, and after that, they were told to bring about 5–10 g of fresh stool specimen each. Initially, a wet mount was prepared, followed by the preservation of the remaining sample in a 10% formalin solution. The collected stool samples were promptly preserved in 10% formalin until microscopy, which helps maintain the shape and size of protozoan and helminth parasites and prevents further development [ A direct wet-mount smear was examined immediately by using normal saline. Observe under a light microscope at 100x and 400x magnifications to detect the presence of motile parasite stages. After preserving the remaining sample in 10% formalin, it was carefully examined using the formol–ether concentration technique along with a modified Ziehl–Neelsen staining method [ Briefly, 1 g of stool was taken from the preserved stool, mixed with a 10% formalin solution, and sieved through double-layered gauze. The filtrate was transferred to a 15-mL conical centrifuge tube and added to 7 mL of formalin saline using a plastic pipette and 3 mL of diethyl ether. Then, the content was shaken vigorously and centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm. After collecting the sediment, a slide was prepared and examined under a light microscope at both 100x and 400x magnification to identify eggs, cysts, and larvae of various parasites. A small portion of the fresh stool sample was processed for the detection of  Before actual data collection began, experienced laboratory technologists pretested the questionnaire and other materials, such as the microscope, centrifuge, and chemicals used during data collection. The specimens were also checked for serial number, quality, and collection procedures. The stool samples were examined by two laboratory technicians in order to avoid observer bias. If conflicting results were found, a different technician examined the stool sample slide, and their findings were deemed conclusive. In addition to the color atlas, the laboratory technicians used known positive coccidian parasite samples as positive controls and performed staining. Furthermore, the researchers validated their staining procedure against the literature using known positive samples to ensure it was functioning as expected. Regarding CD4+ T cells, data collectors were trained, and after the data collection process, the collected data were double-checked for completeness by three investigators, and any incomplete or misfiled data were filed again. Next, the findings from the lab were detailed meticulously on a neatly organized document before being affixed to the survey. Descriptive statistics were used to understand the property and the pattern of data collected from respondents. The data obtained from questionnaires was entered through the EPI-INFO 7 computer program for precoding data and then exported to SPSS Version 23. A chi-square test was applied to determine the association between parasitic infection and CD4+ T cell count. The logistic regression model was employed to assess potential risk factors. The strength of associations was measured using odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Multivariate regression analysis was then applied for variables with  In general, our research adhered to the guidelines set out in the Declaration of Helsinki [ A total of 384 HIV-positive individuals were included. Of these, 222 (57.8%) were females, and 215 (56.0) of the respondents were aged 30–49, with the mean (SD) age of 34.30 (± 11.073) years.

Among these, 122 (31.7%) were found positive for an intestinal parasite (both opportunistic and nonopportunistic parasite species). The overall prevalence of opportunistic parasite infections was found to be 69/384 (17.96%). From 122 positive cases, 110 (28.7%) were infected with single parasites ( In this study, eight species of intestinal parasites were detected. Of these parasites, five belonged to protozoans, and the remaining three belonged to helminthic parasites. The most frequent parasite species detected from the opportunistic intestinal protozoan parasites was  There were (3.1%) cases of double infections with opportunistic intestinal protozoan–protozoan and protozoan–helminths observed. Among the double infections, all (12) cases displayed coccidian parasites ( In multivariate logistic regression analysis, patients who lived in rural areas were less likely to acquire OIPs than patients who had lived in urban areas (AOR = 0.197%, 95% CI: 0.053–0.734,  Patients whose CD4 The proportion of OIPs was significantly higher in patients with a CD4 On the other hand, 98 study participants had a CD4 Individuals with a weakened immune system are more susceptible to intestinal parasites. People with HIV/AIDS often have intestinal parasite infections. HIV weakens the immune system, making it easier for intestinal parasites to cause malnutrition, weight loss, and ongoing diarrhea, making the patient''s health worse [ In the current study, the prevalence of OIPs among HIV/AIDS patients who attend ART was 17.96%. It is consistent with studies conducted in Arba Minch (17.2%) [ 
 The second OIP identified was

Eshetu and colleagues [ The risk of acquiring OIP infection was 7.03 (95% CI: 1.882–26.512,  In this finding, poor adherence to ART drugs was 7.42 times more likely to be infected by OIPs when compared to good adherence (AOR = 7.427, 95% CI: 2.488–22.172,  In this finding, patients residing in rural areas were less likely to be at risk for OIP when compared with urban residents. The findings of the current study support the previous research conducted in Burkina Faso [ In the current study, HIV/AIDS patients who had drinking water from unprotected sources were 14.721 times more likely to harbor OIPs than those using tap water.

VALUES ('Cancer Screening Progress and Non-invasive Screening Opportunities Since Onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic', 'Cancer screening lowers morbidity and mortality from cancer, and is cost-effective. The COVID-19 pandemic upended cancer screening utilization in 2020 with data showing a deficit in screened patients in 2020 and 2021 as compared to 2019, with return to 2019 baseline screening levels by December 2022. The cumulative shortfall in screenings, lasting nearly three years into the pandemic, are predicted by models to generate an incremental population cancer burden in the out years of the models. Recovery of screening rates may vary based on the racial or ethnic population, and time will tell if there is an uneven burden of future cancers that worsen cancer incidence and mortality in those populations, some even after years of gains of reducing disparities for cancer screening. For some cancer screenings, particularly cervical and colorectal cancer, use of at-home non-invasive tests may increase screening participation overall across multiple populations, and may help mitigate some of the screening shortfalls from 2020 to 2022 by elevating numbers of the population screened.

VALUES ('Genetic ancestry superpopulations show distinct prevalence and outcomes across pediatric central nervous system tumors from the Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas and Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium', 'Central nervous system (CNS) tumors lead to cancer-related mortality in children. Genetic ancestry-associated cancer prevalence and outcomes have been studied but are limited. We performed genetic ancestry prediction in 1,452 pediatric patients with paired normal and tumor whole genome sequencing from the Open Pediatric Cancer (OpenPedCan) project to evaluate the influence of reported race and ethnicity and ancestry-based genetic superpopulations on tumor histology, molecular subtype, survival, and treatment. Predicted superpopulations included African (AFR,  Genetic ancestry-associated differences exist across pediatric CNS tumor histological and molecular subtypes from PBTA and PNOC. Further investigation into genetic and socioeconomic factors contributing to these observed inequities is needed. Distinct associations of genetic ancestry-based superpopulations exist within pediatric CNS tumor histologic and molecular subtypes and correlate with survival outcomes and treatment. This work provides critical insight into the impact of reported race and ethnicity and genetic-based ancestry superpopulations on nearly 1500 pediatric patients with CNS tumors who had matched normal and tumor sequencing performed. We identify novel associations between ancestry superpopulations and tumor histology, molecular subtypes, and treatments received. Here, we begin to inform on the contributions of social constructs of race and ethnicity and tumor characteristics that are enriched among genetic-based ancestry superpopulations on clinical outcomes of pediatric patients with CNS tumors. Our findings indicate that potential social and genetic risk stratifications exist for pediatric CNS tumors and warrant further investigation to ensure equitable clinical outcomes for all patients. Primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in children. It is essential to recognize that race and ethnicity are social and cultural constructs distinct from genetic ancestry, which can be estimated using genetic markers that capture ancestral population migration patterns and admixture events. In the current study, we aim to go beyond previous work investigating genomic correlates of cancer risk in isolated silos and utilize a large cohort of patients with broad histologies of primary pediatric CNS tumors to explore the potential contributions of genomics and social health risk categories. We specifically utilize predicted genetic ancestries to evaluate associations with incidence and clinical outcomes across a diverse group of pediatric CNS tumor diagnoses. This work provides an essential framework to better characterize the contributions of genetic and sociodemographic factors to cancer outcomes in patients with pediatric CNS tumors, and ideally augment our understanding of pediatric CNS tumor risk stratification through a lens of health equity. The pediatric CNS tumor patient cohort used in this study was derived from the Open Pediatric Cancer (OpenPedCan) project, We used the somalier suite of tools (v.0.2.15) to predict ancestry superpopulations from non-tumor WGS data. All high-confidence, in-frame  The association between reported race and ethnicity and genetic ancestry superpopulation, as well as superpopulation enrichment within race and ethnicity groups, was assessed using Fisher’s exact tests. We integrated CNS tumor histology and molecular subtype data from matched tumor samples with survival data to determine whether genetic ancestry superpopulations were associated with cancer type, subtype, and/or survival. Nonrandom distribution and enrichment of superpopulations within histologies and molecular subtypes were assessed using Fisher’s exact tests and one-way Fisher’s exact tests, respectively. Statistical significance was defined as Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted FDR < 0.05, and marginally significant trends were defined as  We performed Kaplan–Meier analysis of OS and EFS within histologies and molecular subtypes to compare outcomes of patients of different genetic ancestry groups. We generated Cox proportional-hazards regression models to identify additional variables that were predictive of survival using the following covariates: predicted genetic ancestry superpopulation, age at diagnosis (all models), molecular subtype (ATRT, LGG, HGG, ependymoma [EPN], medulloblastoma [MB], mixed glioneuronal tumors), and extent of tumor resection (ATRT, LGG, EPN, HGG, MB, and schwannoma, to accommodate the known impact of degree of resection on outcome in these cohorts). We generated separate models replacing ancestry superpopulation with (1) EUR membership (EUR or non-EUR) and (2) somalier PC values to assess whether other measures of genetic ancestry were associated with distinct survival outcomes. Chi-square analyses were run on each multivariate model to assess the overall effect of superpopulation on survival in each independent tumor histology or molecular subtype cohort. To assess the association between  We predicted genetic ancestry for 1452 pediatric CNS tumor patients from the PBTA and PNOC. Patients were classified into genetic ancestry superpopulations as follows:  Genetic ancestry prediction in a pediatric central nervous system tumor cohort.  There was a significant nonrandom association between reported race and ethnicity and superpopulation ( We identified a significant nonrandom association between genetic ancestry superpopulation and CNS tumor histology ( Distribution of CNS tumor histologies and molecular subtypes across genetic ancestry superpopulations.

 We also observed breakpoint type-specific distribution of LGG tumors in CNS regions that correlated with the extent of tumor resection ( We identified eleven patients with seven distinct rare  We calculated median EFS and OS for each CNS tumor histology and molecular subtype with sufficient sample size ( Next, we assessed pairwise differences in patient survival by superpopulation within the cohorts selected above. Among patients with GCTs, those from non-EUR superpopulations exhibited significantly worse EFS relative to those from the EUR superpopulation (median EFS 0.5 vs. 2.1 years, HR = 12.1, 95% CI = 1.9–79.6,  Genetic ancestry-associated overall and event-free survival (EFS) differences in pediatric CNS tumor patients.

( We further assessed whether frequency of proton versus photon radiation therapy differed across superpopulations. There was a trend toward genetic ancestry-dependent frequency of upfront proton radiation treatment across all tumor histologies ( We incorporated clinical trial and radiation therapy data into survival models to determine if treatment was associated with survival outcomes in tumor histologies for which genetic ancestry was a significant predictor of survival. There was no significant effect of treatment on survival for patients with LGG, EPN, or GCTs, indicating that statistically significant ancestry-related differences in survival were not statistically associated with clinical trial enrollment in our cohort ( In this study, we sought to investigate the influence of genetic ancestry on the prevalence of CNS tumor subtypes, treatment access, and survival outcomes in pediatric patients. Our findings revealed significant associations between genetic ancestry superpopulations, prevalence of CNS tumor histologies and molecular subtypes, patient OS and EFS, and upfront treatment approaches. Notably, we also identified superpopulation-specific enrichment of  Race and ethnicity are social constructs based on membership in a group sharing cultural and behavioral traits, whereas genetic ancestry is based on variations in genomic structure between groups from similar geographic regions. We found significant associations between ancestry superpopulations and cancer groups. Patients with ATRT or meningioma tumors were significantly enriched among AFR patients. While previous work has shown an increased incidence of meningiomas among patients of reported Black race, We next report associations between predicted ancestry superpopulation and tumor molecular subtypes. EUR superpopulation patients with LGG diagnoses had tumors enriched with non- In our analysis of LGG breakpoint type frequency, we found that 93.6% of patients harbored one of the four common  In this cohort, we found that patients of predicted non-European ancestry exhibited significantly worse OS and EFS compared to patients of predicted European ancestry in certain tumor histologies and molecular subtypes. Patients of non-EUR ancestry with GCT and of AMR ancestry with SHH medulloblastomas had worse EFS compared to EUR patients with the same diagnoses. AFR superpopulation patients with LGG or EPN showed significantly worse OS compared to EUR patients, consistent with prior findings of lower survival among Black children with these tumors. Our study also found varying upfront clinical trial enrollment frequencies by genetic ancestry superpopulation. This is encouraging, as it highlights the importance of including patients from diverse genetic backgrounds in clinical research and may represent contemporary changes that better facilitate equitable enrollment in trials and research activities. Although our work included patients from a diverse set of genetic and predicted ancestral backgrounds, our data came from patients within the United States. Thus, our cohort was significantly enriched for the European superpopulation, with limited numbers of historically marginalized racial and ethnic groups in our study (ie, AI/AN and NHPI). Expanding access to international pediatric datasets with potentially unique SDoH considerations will be critical for including diverse representation in future research. While the inclusion of molecular subtypes in our analyses allowed for a more nuanced exploration of tumor risk across superpopulations, our sample sizes for several subtypes were limited. We report our findings with full consideration of these small sample sizes, which we hope to mitigate with ongoing enrollment and larger sample sizes in planned follow-up reports. Further, the discovery of novel molecular features and further subdivision of current molecular subtypes may lead to reduced power to detect ancestry-associated prevalence and outcomes. For example, the  Importantly, our work did not consider the contributions of SDoH to survival, such as socioeconomic status, insurance status, and time to diagnosis, which are well-known to impact survival. Our work revealed several new findings in pediatric CNS tumor histologies and molecular subtypes across genetic superpopulations, highlighting associations with survival and upfront treatment approaches. To further improve equity in care and outcomes for children with CNS malignancies, additional research is needed to delineate the extent to which race and ethnicity differences are driven by societal determinants or tumor biology and molecular subtypes related to genetic ancestry.

VALUES ('Research on mammary gland hyperplasia compound patents’ herbal combination rules based on complex system entropy clustering: A review', 'The aim of this study was to investigate the combination rules of herbal compound patents for the treatment of mammary gland hyperplasia (MGH). Herbal compound patents (oral drugs) for the treatment of MGH from the past 31 years were collected, and a database was created. Complex system entropy clustering was used to analyze the prescription rule of herbal compound patents for the treatment of MGH. In total, 765 MGH herbal compound authorized patents, including 136 Chinese herbs, were identified. High-frequency herbs, herbal pairs, and core associations were obtained by complex system entropy clustering. MGH herbal compound patents are known to activate blood circulation, remove stasis, soothe the liver, regulate  Mammary gland hyperplasia (MGH) is a common gynecological disease among young and middle-aged women whose incidence is increasing year by year, which seriously affects the patient’s quality of life. Androgens, progesterone (P), tamoxifen, bromocriptine, danazol and other hormonal drugs are commonly used to treat this disease. However, although these drugs can improve the symptoms of MGH, their side effects are severe. Notably, the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) compound prescription for treating MGH shows its effectiveness in the treatment of this disease. In long-term clinical practice, TCM has accumulated numerous herbal compounds with outstanding curative effects. The herbal combination pattern determined by complex system-based entropy clustering could enhance the accuracy of clinical prescriptions, making the selection of herbal core combinations easier and more accurate. There are many academic cores in the MGH herbal compound patents, which will have remarkable curative effect on clinical treatment. In this study, the patents for oral herb prescriptions for MGH treatment from the past 30 years were selected for analysis. Herbal frequency, association, and composition compatibility regularity were investigated to guide the clinical prescription and development of new drugs. This study introduces the boundary mutual distance into the mutual information registration measure. By combining mutual information and mutual distance information, the resulting new registration measure improves the mutual information registration measuring function, thus reducing the risk of the conventional maximum mutual information function falling into the extremum and defining the accurate ratio of information about the MGH patent compound composition (Figs.

The EpiData 3.1 system (EpiData Association, Odense, Denmark) was used to develop the data mining software. Each eligible MGH prescription patent herb was assigned a 2-valued variable. Data mining was performed using mathematical entropy modeling and screening out herbal pairs and core combinations with strong efficacy coherence. Complex system entropy clustering and improved mutual information methods were used to construct the research program and create the research model in order to initiate the quantitative description of the correlation coefficient of Chinese medicine. The ultimate purpose was to extract the herbal pairs and herbal core combinations. Mathematical modeling was used to mine the MGH prescription patents. The most relevant core combinations of Chinese herbs were screened out by mathematical calculations, comprising core herbal pairs and herbal teams.

Verification of the statistical significance of the results: Significance testing of occurrence of high frequency herbs: The chi-square test was used to verify the frequency of occurrence of high frequency herbs. The reliability of frequency estimation was analyzed by confidence intervals to avoid small-sample errors. Robustness of cluster analysis: The sensitivity of parameters in the entropy clustering (such as the selection of threshold δ) was evaluated. The stability of core combinations was observed by adjusting the parameters multiple times and repeating the clustering process. The silhouette coefficient and cluster stability index were used to evaluate the clustering quality by measuring the average intra-cluster distance and the inter-cluster distance. Quantitative evaluation of association rules: The support and confidence of herbal pairs and core combinations were calculated, and the strength of the association was determined using the lift metric. The a priori algorithm and Frequent-Pattern-Growth (FP-Growth) algorithm were used for 2-way verification of the statistical significance for high frequency combinations. Time-trend analysis: The data of the patents from different time periods (such as every 10 years) was analyzed to determine the stability of high frequency herbal combinations and exclude historical biases.

Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA) can promote the growth and proliferation of endothelial cells and increase the permeability of blood vessels.

VEGFA can not only increase the permeability of vascular endothelial cells, but also induce the development of new mechanisms and new blood vessels by increasing vascular permeability. FGF2 is a direct inducer of angiogenesis, which can promote the regeneration of epidermal cells and endothelial cells, induce the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells and detach them from the basement membrane, which in turn induce chemotaxis of endothelial cells towards breast variant cells. Herbs with liver soothing effect inhibit the proliferation of breast cells by downregulating the expression of angiogenic factors (VEGFA and FGF2), thereby improving pituitary and ovarian function, regulating endocrine function, and improving microcirculation and local blood circulation.

Herbs with  Herbs with  The results revealed that the herbs with heat-clearing and detoxification properties have a large number in MGH effective patents: herbs with heat-clearing properties (985, Table  According to the medical theory of the Zhuang ethnic minority in China, there are 3 important avenues (heaven, earth, and human) and 2 pathways (blood transportation, and information sensing) in the human body. An unobstructed state is important for the 3 important avenues and 2 pathways, which results in the harmony of  “Poison” is a general term in the medical theory of the Zhuang ethnic minority in China. Whether the virus causes a disease after invading human body depends on the virulence strength and the human health status. If the virulence is too strong or the physical condition of the host is poor, the body energy and evil poison compete with each other, but the body energy is powerless against the evil poison, thus the 3 important avenues (heaven, earth, human) and 2 pathways (blood transportation, information sensing) are blocked by the evil poison, which results in diseases. MGH is mainly caused by the invasion of wind poison, cold poison, wet poison, heat poison and other toxic pathogens, which stagnate in the viscera and bone marrow, and obstruct the 3 important avenues and 2 pathways. The accumulation of evil poison leads to heat and swelling pain; thus the ways of clearing heat and detoxification are common treatments for MGH. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a processivity factor for the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase responsible for the synthesis of the DNA leading strand in DNA replication, which is essential for timely and faithful replication of DNA genome, The expression of PCNA is related to cell cycle, and is the weakest in the static stage, but active in the proliferating and transmutation stages. The PCNA index is one of the important indexes to evaluate the proliferative state of the cell. One of the pathological manifestations of MGH is the hyperplasia of catheter epithelial cells and interstitial fibrous tissue. The hyperplastic breast tissue is in a highly active proliferation state, and the expression of PCNA is significantly increased. Herbs with heat-clearing and detoxification properties can inhibit the PCNA protein synthesis and gene expression by preventing cell entry into the S-phase and inducing the DNA synthesis, which reduce the E The results of research studies have shown that the herbs’ frequency for reducing lumps and dispersing knots was 938 (Table  The results of research studies have shown that the herbs’ frequency of eliminating phlegm was 440 (Table  Sputum stagnation is an important etiology and pathogenesis of MGH. Exogenous pathogenic factors, emotional injury and diet fatigue, result in the 5 viscera system (mainly lung, spleen, and kidney) and  Among the high frequency herbs,  MGH often manifests as the loss of positive energy and accumulation of pathological products.  Medical pair and core combination of herbs are commonly used and relatively fixed forms of herbal combination in clinical practice, and are the smallest prescription unit, which have the basic function of prescriptions and show the overall efficacy of prescriptions. The study on its compatibility combinations is of great value to reveal the compatibility laws and scientific connotations of prescriptions. Among the effective patents of herbal prescriptions, the combinations of promoting  The herbal combination of promoting blood circulation and promoting  Activating blood circulation in combination with activating  The activity of super oxide dismutase (SOD) in MGH tissue clearly decreases, while the content of the lipid peroxidation metabolite malondialdehyde (MDA) increases. The combination of promoting blood circulation and promoting  Among the effective patents of herbal prescriptions for preventing and treating breast hyperplasia, the combination of nourishing blood and promoting blood circulation is widely used (Table  Supplementing blood and promoting blood circulation are mainly aimed at the type of nutrient deficiency and excess of pathogenic factors in MGH, namely the type of blood deficiency and stasis. Blood deficiency refers to insufficient blood storage, and results in a decrease in the nutritional and nourishing function of blood, which lead to dysfunction of organs and tissues due to loss of nourishment. The dysfunction of the liver in storing blood and regulating blood volume leads to abnormal blood flow, blood leaves the meridians and remains outside the veins, which causes blood stasis. Blood stasis does not go, new blood is not produced, so the cycle is repeated, which is the type of blood deficiency and blood stasis obstruction in breast hyperplasia. Patients usually have breast lumps, pain like acupuncture, pale face, dry and rough skin, withered hair, brittle claws dim vision, numbness of hands and feet, poor flexion and extension of limbs, palpitations, insomnia, dreaminess, forgetfulness. Herbs that can nourish blood and are used to treat blood deficiency are called blood tonics. It is mild in nature, sweet in taste, and belongs to the liver, spleen, and kidney meridians. The pharmacological effects of preventing and treating MGH are as follows: improve bone marrow hematopoietic function; resistance to hypoxia; dilating coronary artery, reducing myocardial oxygen consumption, increasing myocardial blood flow; nourishing blood and liver, reducing serum transaminases, increasing liver glycogen, and improving liver microcirculation. Blood stasis is related to various pathological factors, including blood viscosity, disorders of microcirculation and blood circulation, platelet activation and adhesion aggregation, abnormal tissue cell metabolism and immune function metabolism, etc. Herbs that have the effects of unblocking blood vessels, dispelling blood stasis, and treating blood stasis blockages are called blood activating and stasis resolving herbs. These herbs have a relatively mild nature (soft nature, slightly cold, or slightly warm), enter 3 meridians (heart, liver, and spleen). They have the functions of promoting blood circulation, relieving pain, regulating menstruation, removing blood stasis and removing ecchymosis spots. The pharmacological action of herbs for promoting blood circulation and resolving blood stasis in the treatment of MGH are as follows: improving blood rheology and preventing thrombosis; improving microvascular status and blood flow; reducing the permeability of capillaries, reducing or clearing blood leakage around microvessels; reducing serum total cholesterol, neutral fat, and β-lipoprotein; and improving hemodynamics, dilating peripheral blood vessels, and increasing organ blood flow. Among the effective patents’ herbal pairs, there were many herbs for reducing swelling, dispersing nodules, and purulent drainage combined with herbs for promoting blood circulation (Table  In TCM theory it is believed that blood is the carrier of  Chinese herbs for promoting blood circulation and dispersing nodules can effectively improve breast blood circulation, reduce blood viscosity, alleviate pain, inhibit glandular hyperplasia, and promote fibrous tissue absorption. They can adjust the liver’s ability to inactivate hormones, improve liver and systemic blood circulation, and promote hormone metabolism in the body. Herbs for resolving phlegm, softening hardness, and dispersing nodules can promote the absorption of pathological products and inflammatory exudates, promote the dissipation of fibrous tissue and other substances around the glands, thus inhibiting breast gland hyperplasia. The iodine components in herbs for reducing swelling and dissipating nodules can stimulate the production of P in the anterior pituitary gland, reduce estrogen levels in the body, thus can be used to treat breast hyperplasia. It was recorded in  The main components of  Angelica polysaccharides can affect the hematopoietic system, and significantly promote the proliferation and differentiation of mouse hematopoietic stem cells (Colony-Forming Unit-Spleen), mouse and human myeloid progenitor cells (Burst-Forming Unit-Erythroid, Colony-Forming Unit-Erythroid, Colony-Forming Unit-Granulocyte/Macrophage, and Colony-Forming Unit-Megakaryocyte).

The herbal pair ( This herbal pair also interferes with the activation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 signaling pathway by influencing the IFNG-induced T-box transcription factor 21 expression in bone marrow cells in the bone marrow microenvironment, thereby restoring the balance of the T cell immune response network. This herbal pair can regulate the number of T cell subpopulations, transformation and proliferation capacity, adrenal function of rats with  The complement C3b/C4b receptor 1 (CR1) on the red cell membrane, the C3b molecule in the attached immune complex or the C3b molecule in the antigenic complement complex can respectively adhere to yeast polysaccharides, complement-sensitized yeast and -non-sensitized yeast, to form rose wreaths (E-C3bRR) and immune complex wreaths (E-ICR). The herbal pair ( Blood stasis often manifests as a state of viscosity, high concentration, condensation and aggregation, as well as changes in tangible composition (increased blood lipids and blood sugar). The herbal pair ( This herbal pair ( Blood stasis is a pathological condition caused by the break of the balance between blood fluid and blood tube, which results from either restrained or overactive circulation of blood fluid. Moreover, in rats with liver fibrosis, it can reduce VEGFA, angiotensin I, and transforming growth factor beta 1, as well as the expression of its signal transmission medium, exert antiangiogenic effects by alleviating oxidative stress. The iron in the herbal pair ( This herbal pair can also inhibit the expression of liver ferritin, increase the accumulation of endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1 protein, restore erythropoietin synthesis, activate the Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. It can restrain the overexpression of elemental iron regulatory factors by regulating the hepcidin coding gene (hepcidin antimicrobial peptide), which improve iron metabolism, and can be used to treat breast hyperplasia induced by blood deficiency. The herbal pair ( The herbal pair ( The TNF signaling pathway is involved in the inflammatory response. The herbal pair ( The effects of the main effective components of the herbal pair ( Sitosterol and stigmasterol can prevent arrest of breast cells in the DNA synthesis phase of cell division, inhibit cell proliferation, and promote cell apoptosis. Phytosterols can enhance the proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes and T cells, enhance the immune response, and prevent the development of MGH from the perspective of immunosuppression. Isorhamnetin can promote cell apoptosis by binding with autophagy/mitosis inhibitors, and can also inhibit breast cell proliferation by inhibiting cell growth, causing cytotoxicity, increasing oxidative stress, and blocking cell cycle progression. Kaempferol is associated with multiple signaling pathways, such as the EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor)/PI3K/Akt, and Notch1 (Neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 1)/PI3K/Akst pathways, upregulates proapoptotic proteins BAX and CASP3, downregulates antiapoptotic protein BCL2, thereby blocking cell cycle and promoting cell apoptosis. Kaempferol can also significantly reduce the expression of interleukin 6 and interleukin 1B, and exhibits a dose dependence, thereby alleviating the degree of breast hyperplasia.

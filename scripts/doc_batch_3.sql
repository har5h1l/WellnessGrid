For most adults, moderate alcohol use is probably not harmful. Your risk of developing an alcohol use disorder (AUD) depends on how much, how often, and how quickly you drink alcohol. Alcohol misuse means that drinking causes distress and harm. Over time alcohol misuse can increase your risk of AUD. AUD can range from mild to severe, depending on the symptoms. Severe AUD is sometimes called alcoholism or alcohol dependence. AUD is a disease that causes: Craving - a strong need to drink Loss of control - not being able to stop drinking once you''ve started Negative emotional state - feeling anxious and irritable when you are not drinking What is binge drinking? Binge drinking is a type of alcohol misuse. It means drinking so much at once that your blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level is 0.08% or more. For a man, this usually happens after having 5 or more drinks within a few hours. For a woman, it is after about 4 or more drinks within a few hours. Not everyone who binge drinks has an AUD, but they are at higher risk for getting one. What are the dangers of too much alcohol? Too much alcohol is dangerous. Heavy drinking can increase the risk of certain cancers. It may lead to liver diseases, such as fatty liver disease and cirrhosis. It can also cause damage to the brain and other organs. Drinking during pregnancy can harm your fetus. Alcohol also increases the risk of death from car crashes, injuries, homicide, and suicide. How do I know if I have an alcohol use disorder (AUD)? You may have an AUD if you can answer yes to two or more of these questions: In the past year, have you: Ended up drinking more or for a longer time than you had planned to? Wanted to cut down or stop drinking, or tried to, but couldn''t? Spent a lot of your time drinking or recovering from drinking? Felt a strong need to drink? Found that drinking - or being sick from drinking - often interfered with your family life, job, or school? Kept drinking even though it was causing trouble with your family or friends? Given up or cut back on activities that you enjoyed just so you could drink? Gotten into dangerous situations while drinking or after drinking? Some examples are driving drunk and having unsafe sex. Kept drinking even though it was making you feel depressed or anxious? Or when it was adding to another health problem? Had to drink more and more to feel the effects of the alcohol? Had withdrawal symptoms when the alcohol was wearing off? They include trouble sleeping, shakiness, irritability, anxiety, depression, restlessness, nausea, and sweating. In severe cases, you could have a fever, seizures, or hallucinations. If you have any of these symptoms, your drinking may already be a cause for concern. The more symptoms you have, the more serious the problem is. What should I do if I think that I might have an alcohol use disorder (AUD)? If you think you might have an AUD, see your health care provider for an evaluation. Your provider can help make a treatment plan, prescribe medicines, and if needed, give you treatment referrals.

Vaccines are injections (shots), liquids, pills, or nasal sprays that you take to teach your body''s immune system to recognize and defend against harmful germs. For example, there are vaccines to protect against diseases caused by: Viruses, like the ones that cause the flu and COVID-19 Bacteria, including tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis What are the types of vaccines? There are several types of vaccines: Live-attenuated vaccines use a weakened form of the germ. Inactivated vaccines use a killed version of the germ. Subunit, recombinant, polysaccharide, and conjugate vaccines use only specific pieces of the germ, such as its protein, sugar, or casing. Toxoid vaccines use a toxin (harmful product) made by the germ. mRNA vaccines use messenger RNA, which gives your cells instructions for how to make a protein (or piece of a protein) of the germ. Viral vector vaccines use genetic material, which gives your cells instructions for making a protein of the germ. These vaccines also contain a different, harmless virus that helps get the genetic material into your cells. These vaccines may work in different ways, but they all spark an immune response. The immune response is the way your body defends itself against substances it sees as foreign or harmful. These substances include germs that can cause disease. What happens in an immune response? There are different steps in the immune response: When a germ invades, your body sees it as foreign. Your immune system helps your body fight off the germ. Your immune system also remembers the germ. It will attack the germ if it ever invades again. This "memory" protects you against the disease that the germ causes. This type of protection is called immunity. What are immunization and vaccination? Immunization is the process of becoming protected against a disease. But it can also mean the same thing as vaccination, which is getting a vaccine to become protected against a disease. Why are vaccines important? Vaccines are important because they protect you against many diseases. These diseases can be very serious. So getting immunity from a vaccine is safer than getting immunity by being sick with the disease. For a few vaccines, getting vaccinated can actually give you a better immune response than getting the disease would. But vaccines don''t just protect you. They also protect the people around you through community immunity. What is community immunity? Community immunity, or herd immunity, is the idea that vaccines can help keep communities healthy. Normally, germs can travel quickly through a community and make a lot of people sick. If enough people get sick, it can lead to an outbreak. But when enough people are vaccinated against a certain disease, it''s harder for that disease to spread to others. This type of protection means that the entire community is less likely to get the disease. Community immunity is especially important for people who can''t get certain vaccines. For example, they may not be able to get a vaccine because they have weakened immune systems. Others may be allergic to certain vaccine ingredients. And newborn babies are too young to get some vaccines. Community immunity can help to protect them all. Are vaccines safe? Vaccines are safe. They must go through extensive safety testing and evaluation before they are approved in the United States. What is a vaccine schedule? A vaccine, or immunization, schedule lists which vaccines are recommended for different groups of people. It includes who should get the vaccines, how many doses they need, and when they should get them. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes the vaccine schedule. It''s important for both children and adults to get their vaccines according to the schedule. Following the schedule allows them to get protection from the diseases at exactly the right time.

Germs are microorganisms. This means that they can be seen only through a microscope. They can be found everywhere - in the air, soil, and water. There are also germs on your skin and in your body. Many germs live in and on our bodies without causing harm. Some even help us to stay healthy. But some germs can make you sick. Infectious diseases are diseases that are caused by germs. The main types of germs are bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. How do germs spread? There are different ways that germs can spread, including: Through touching a person who has the germs or making other close contact with them, such as kissing, hugging, or sharing cups or eating utensils Through breathing air after a person with the germs coughs or sneezes Through touching the feces (poop) of someone who has the germs, such as changing diapers, then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth Through touching objects and surfaces that have germs on them, then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth From mother to baby during pregnancy and/or childbirth From insect or animal bites From contaminated food, water, soil, or plants How can I protect myself and others from germs? You can help protect yourself and others from germs: When you have to cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or use the inside of your elbow Wash your hands well and often. You should scrub them for at least 20 seconds. It is important to do this when you are most likely to get and spread germs: Before, during, and after preparing food Before eating food Before and after caring for someone at home who is sick with vomiting or diarrhea Before and after treating a cut or wound After using the toilet After changing diapers or cleaning up a child who has used the toilet After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing After touching an animal, animal feed, or animal waste After handling pet food or pet treats After touching garbage If soap and water are not available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol Stay home if you are sick Avoid close contact with people who are sick Practice food safety when handling, cooking, and storing food Regularly clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects Start Here About Handwashing (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) About Hygiene (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Germs: Understand and Protect against Bacteria, Viruses, and Infections (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research) Also in Spanish Hand Hygiene Frequently Asked Questions (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Your Body''s Bugs: Nurturing Healthy Microbes (National Institutes of Health) Also in Spanish Prevention and Risk Factors Eight Ways to Guard Against Germs in Everyday Life (Cystic Fibrosis Foundation) - PDF Hand Washing: Do''s and Dont''s (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research) Also in Spanish Specifics Hand Sanitizer Facts (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Healthy Habits: Coughing and Sneezing (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) How to Make Water Safe in an Emergency (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) If Soap and Water Are Not Available, Hand Sanitizers May Be a Good Alternative (Food and Drug Administration) Also in Spanish Preventing Swimming-related Illnesses (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Also in Spanish Q&A for Consumers: Hand Sanitizers and COVID-19 (Food and Drug Administration) Also in Spanish Safely Using Hand Sanitizer (Food and Drug Administration) Also in Spanish Skip the Antibacterial Soap; Use Plain Soap and Water (Food and Drug Administration) Staying Safe in the Water: Guard Against Germs While Swimming (National Institutes of Health) Also in Spanish Clinical Trials ClinicalTrials.gov: Disinfection (National Institutes of Health) ClinicalTrials.gov: Hand Hygiene (National Institutes of Health) ClinicalTrials.gov: Hand Sanitizers (National Institutes of Health) ClinicalTrials.gov: Handwashing (National Institutes of Health) Journal Articles References and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine) Article: Reprocessing status of flexible bronchoscopes in 202 intensive care units in...

A stroke happens when there is a loss of blood flow to part of the brain. Your brain cells cannot get the oxygen and nutrients they need from blood, and they start to die within a few minutes. This can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death. If you think that you or someone else is having a stroke, call 911 right away. Immediate treatment may save someone''s life and increase the chances for successful rehabilitation and recovery. What are the types of stroke? There are two types of stroke: Ischemic stroke is caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. This is the most common type; about 80% of strokes are ischemic. Hemorrhagic stroke is caused by a blood vessel that breaks and bleeds into the brain Another condition that''s similar to a stroke is a transient ischemic attack (TIA). It''s sometimes called a "mini-stroke." TIAs happen when the blood supply to the brain is blocked for a short time. The damage to the brain cells isn''t permanent, but if you have had a TIA, you are at a much higher risk of having a stroke. Who is at risk for a stroke? Certain factors can raise your risk of a stroke. The major risk factors include: High blood pressure. This is the primary risk factor for a stroke. Diabetes. Heart diseases. Atrial fibrillation and other heart diseases can cause blood clots that lead to stroke. Smoking. When you smoke, you damage your blood vessels and raise your blood pressure. A personal or family history of stroke or TIA. Age. Your risk of stroke increases as you get older. Race and ethnicity. African Americans have a higher risk of stroke. There are also other factors that are linked to a higher risk of stroke, such as: Alcohol and illegal drug use Not getting enough physical activity High cholesterol Unhealthy diet Having obesity What are the symptoms of stroke? The symptoms of stroke often happen quickly. They include: Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg (especially on one side of the body) Sudden confusion, trouble speaking, or understanding speech Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes Sudden difficulty walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination Sudden severe headache with no known cause If you think that you or someone else is having a stroke, call 911 right away. How are strokes diagnosed? To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will: Ask about your symptoms and medical history Do a physical exam, including a check of Your mental alertness Your coordination and balance Any numbness or weakness in your face, arms, and legs Any trouble speaking and seeing clearly Run some tests, which may include Diagnostic imaging of the brain, such as a CT scan or MRI Heart tests, which can help detect heart problems or blood clots that may have led to a stroke. Possible tests include an electrocardiogram (EKG) and an echocardiography. What are the treatments for stroke? Treatments for stroke include medicines, surgery, and rehabilitation. Which treatments you get depend on the type of stroke and the stage of treatment. The different stages are: Acute treatment, to try to stop a stroke while it is happening Post-stroke rehabilitation, to overcome the disabilities caused by the stroke Prevention, to prevent a first stroke or, if you have already had one, prevent another stroke Acute treatments for ischemic stroke are usually medicines: You may get tPA, (tissue plasminogen activator), a medicine to dissolve the blood clot. You can only get this medicine within 4 hours of when your symptoms started. The sooner you can get it, the better your chance of recovery. If you cannot get that medicine, you may get medicine that helps stop platelets from clumping together to form blood clots. Or you may get a blood thinner to keep existing clots from getting bigger. If you have carotid artery disease, you may also need a procedure to open your blocked carotid artery Acute treatments for hemorrhagic stroke focus on stopping the bleeding. The first step is to find the cause of bleeding in the brain. The next step is to control it: If high blood pressure is the cause of bleeding, you may be given blood pressure medicines. If an aneurysm if the cause, you may need aneurysm clipping or coil embolization. These are surgeries to prevent further leaking of blood from the aneurysm. It also can help prevent the aneurysm from bursting again. If an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is the cause of a stroke, you may need an AVM repair. An AVM is a tangle of faulty arteries and veins that can rupture within the brain. An AVM repair may be done through Surgery Injecting a substance into the blood vessels of the AVM to block blood flow Radiation to shrink the blood vessels of the AVM Stroke rehabilitation can help you relearn skills you lost because of the damage. The goal is to help you become as independent as possible and to have the best possible quality of life. Prevention of another stroke is also important, since having a stroke increases the risk of getting another one. Prevention may include heart-healthy lifestyle changes and medicines. Can strokes be prevented? If you have already had a stroke or are at risk of having a stroke, you can make some heart-healthy lifestyle changes to try to prevent a future stroke: Eating a heart-healthy diet Aiming for a healthy weight Managing stress Getting regular physical activity Quitting smoking Managing your blood pressure and cholesterol levels If these changes aren''t enough, you may need medicine to control your risk factors.

If you feel pain and stiffness in your body or have trouble moving around, you might have arthritis. Any disorder that affects the joints is often called arthritis. Joints are places where two bones meet, such as your elbow or knee. Most types of arthritis can cause joint pain and inflammation (swelling). Over time, a swollen joint can become severely damaged. Some kinds of arthritis can also cause problems in your organs, such as your eyes or skin. Treatment will depend on the type of arthritis you have. What are the types of arthritis? Common types of arthritis include: Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis. It''s often related to aging or injury. Autoimmune arthritis happens when your body''s immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake. Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common form of this type of arthritis. Juvenile arthritis is a type of arthritis that happens in children. Infectious arthritis is an infection that has spread from another part of your body to the joint. Reactive arthritis is one type. Psoriatic arthritis affects people with psoriasis (itchy or sore scaly red and white skin patches). Gout is a painful type of arthritis that happens when too much uric acid builds up in your body. It often starts in the big toe. Other joints can also be affected. Ankylosing spondylitis is a type of arthritis of the spine that can cause stiffness and make it difficult to move and bend. What are the symptoms of arthritis? Pain, redness, warmth, and joint inflammation are common arthritis symptoms. You may not be able to move your joint as well as it should. Other symptoms could include fever, weight loss, breathing difficulties, or a rash. Symptoms often get worse as you age. Some symptoms of arthritis may be signs of other illnesses. Who is more likely to get arthritis? A few things that might increase your chance of getting arthritis include: Family history. You may be more likely to get certain types of arthritis if a member of your family has the disorder. Age. The risk of getting many types of arthritis increases with age. Sex. Certain types of arthritis are more common in women, while other types are more common in men. Other factors that might increase your risk of getting arthritis include having a previous joint injury, obesity, or lupus. How is arthritis diagnosed? To find out if you have arthritis, your health care provider may: Ask you about your medical history, including your symptoms. Do a physical exam. Order blood tests or take x-rays.

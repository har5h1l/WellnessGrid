Every vaccine ingredient serves a purpose To provide immunity We become immune to (or protected from) a disease when our bodies create specific antibodies to fight that disease. Vaccines contain ingredients that help your body build this immunity . To keep the vaccine safe and long-lasting Vaccines need to be safe and effective. Certain ingredients help keep vaccines safe from contamination and toxins. Others, like stabilizers, help vaccines stay effective for a long time. To make the vaccine more effective All vaccine ingredients help to make a vaccine as effective as possible, while being safe.",

      "content": "August 10, 2024 Español Vaccine Basics What to know Modern vaccines contain only the ingredients that are needed for the vaccines to be as safe and effective as possible. Every vaccine ingredient serves a purpose To provide immunity We become immune to (or protected from) a disease when our bodies create specific antibodies to fight that disease. Vaccines contain ingredients that help your body build this immunity. To keep the vaccine safe and long-lasting Vaccines need to be safe and effective. Certain ingredients help keep vaccines safe from contamination and toxins. Others, like stabilizers, help vaccines stay effective for a long time. To make the vaccine more effective All vaccine ingredients help to make a vaccine as effective as possible, while being safe. Ingredients like aluminum salt help boost the body's response to the vaccine. Ingredients found in some vaccines Stabilizers Purpose: To keep the vaccine effective after manufacturing Most commonly found in: Jell-O®, naturally in the body Examples: Sugars, gelatin Adjuvants Purpose: To help boost the body's response to the vaccine Most commonly found in: Drinking water, infant formula, and some health products such as antacids, buffered aspirin, and antiperspirants Examples: Aluminum salts Residual inactivating ingredients Purpose: To kill viruses or inactivate toxins during the manufacturing process Most commonly found in: Naturally in the human body, fruit, household furnishings (carpets, upholstering) Example: FormaldehydeA Residual cell culture materials Purpose: To grow enough of the virus or bacteria to make the vaccine Most commonly found in: Eggs, and foods that contain eggs Examples: Egg proteinB Residual antibiotics Purpose: To prevent contamination by bacteria during the vaccine manufacturing process Most commonly found in: Common antibiotics. Antibiotics that people are most likely to be allergic to—like penicillin—aren't used in vaccines. Examples: Neomycin, Kanamycin, Streptomycin Preservatives Purpose: To prevent contamination Most commonly found in: Some kinds of fish Example: ThimerosalC (only in multi-dose vials of flu vaccine) Most vaccines don't contain any mercury Most vaccines do not have any mercury in them. However, multi-dose flu vaccines and one type of tetanus-diphtheria (Td) vaccine contain a small amount of thimerosal. Thimerosal contains a form of mercury (ethylmercury) that does not cause mercury poisoning and is safe for use in vaccines. Flu and Td vaccines are also available in thimerosal-free versions. Different types of vaccines work in different ways Vaccines can help protect against certain diseases by imitating an infection. This helps teach the immune system how to build immunity to fight off a future infection. Different vaccines provide immunity in different ways. Ingredients in specific vaccines The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is responsible for making sure vaccines are safe and effective, has information about all approved vaccines. Check out the below links to discover the different vaccine options and the various ingredients. Learn about the vaccines that are currently approved in the U.S. by the FDA to prevent different diseases. See approved vaccines Want to know more? Read about common vaccine ingredients from the FDA.

The amount of formaldehyde present in some vaccines is so small compared to the concentration that occurs naturally in the body that it does not pose a safety concern. Because some influenza and yellow fever vaccines are made in eggs, egg proteins are present in the final products. People with severe egg allergies should be vaccinated in a medical setting and be supervised by a health care professional who can recognize and manage severe allergic conditions. For people with egg allergies, there are also flu vaccines that have been made without using eggs in the manufacturing process. Thimerosal contains a different form of mercury (ethylmercury) than the kind that causes mercury poisoning (methylmercury). Ethylmercury is safe to use in vaccines because it's processed differently in the body and is less likely to build up in the body—and because it's used in tiny amounts. Even so, most vaccines do not have any thimerosal in them. Learn more about thimerosal, mercury, and vaccine safety.",

Cancer is not just one disease but many diseases. Cancer begins in your cells, which are the building blocks of your body. Usually, your body forms new cells as needed, replacing old cells that die. Sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells grow even when you don't need them, and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor. Tumors can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer, while malignant ones are. Cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues. They can also break away and spread to other parts of your body. The spread of cancer from one part of the body to another is called metastasis. Symptoms and treatment depend on the type of cancer and how advanced it is. What are the types of cancer? There are more than 100 different types of cancer. Cancer can start almost anywhere in your body. Most cancers are named for where they start. For example, lung cancer starts in the lung, and breast cancer starts in the breast. Cancer may also be described by the type of cell that formed it, such as sarcoma if cancer begins in your bone and soft tissue. Carcinoma is the most common type of cancer. It is formed by epithelial cells, the cells that cover the inside and outside surfaces of your body. How does cancer develop? Cancer is a genetic disease. That means changes in your genes cause it. Changes in your genes are also called gene variants or mutations. Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. However, only some cancers are caused by genes passed down from your parents. Genetic changes can occur to your genes over your lifetime that affect how your cells function. Usually, your body gets rid of damaged cells before they turn cancerous, but this ability goes down as you age. Other factors that may affect your risk of developing cancer can include: Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun Smoking Your diet Physical inactivity What are the symptoms of cancer? Cancer symptoms depend on the type of cancer. For example, some of the symptoms that cancer may cause can include: A lump in your breast Blood in your urine (pee) or stool (poop) Bleeding or bruising for no known reason A sore that doesn't heal Trouble swallowing A new mole or a change to a mole you already have Cancer may cause various symptoms but often doesn't cause pain. Don't wait until you're having pain before seeing your health care provider. See your provider if you have symptoms that don't get better in a few weeks. How is cancer diagnosed? There is no single test that can diagnose cancer. The tests ordered are usually based on your symptoms. Your provider may: Ask about your medical history Ask about your family health history, including relatives who have had cancer Do a physical exam Do a screening test such as a mammogram, colonoscopy, or a Pap test Order blood tests or imaging tests To find out if you have cancer, your provider may order a biopsy. A biopsy is the procedure of removing and examining tissue, cells, or fluids from your body. What are the treatments for cancer? Treatment depends on the type of cancer and how advanced it is. Most treatment plans may include surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy. Some may involve hormone therapy, immunotherapy or other types of biological therapy, or stem cell transplantation. Can cancer be prevented? It's usually not possible to know exactly why cancer develops in some people but not others. There are some things that you can't control which may increase or decrease your risk of getting cancer, such as inheriting certain genes or your age. But some lifestyle habits may increase your risk of certain types of cancer. Avoid or reduce lifestyle habits such as: Smoking and tobacco use Having too much sun exposure Drinking too much alcohol Not getting enough physical activity Having obesity NIH: National Cancer Institute Start Here Cancer (American Academy of Family Physicians) What Is Cancer?

COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is a group of lung diseases that make it hard to breathe and get worse over time. Normally, the airways and air sacs in your lungs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, the airways bring air to the air sacs. The air sacs fill up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate, and the air goes out. If you have COPD, less air flows in and out of your airways because of one or more problems: The airways and air sacs in your lungs become less elastic The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed The airways make more mucus than usual and can become clogged What are the types of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)? COPD includes two main types: Emphysema affects the air sacs in your lungs, as well as the walls between them. They become damaged and are less elastic. Chronic bronchitis, in which the lining of your airways is constantly irritated and inflamed. This causes the lining to swell and make mucus. Most people with COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but how severe each type is can be different from person to person. What causes COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)? The cause of COPD is usually long-term exposure to irritants that damage your lungs and airways. In the United States, cigarette smoke is the main cause. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke can also cause COPD, especially if you inhale them. Exposure to other inhaled irritants can contribute to COPD. These include secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes or dusts from the environment or workplace. Rarely, a genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can play a role in causing COPD. Who is at risk for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)? The risk factors for COPD include: Smoking. This is the main risk factor. Up to 75% of people who have COPD smoke or used to smoke. Long-term exposure to other lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes and dusts from the environment or workplace Age. Most people who have COPD are at least 40 years old when their symptoms begin. Genetics. This includes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which is a genetic condition. Also, smokers who get COPD are more likely to get it if they have a family history of COPD. Asthma. People who have asthma have more risk of developing COPD than people who don't have asthma. But most people with asthma will not get COPD. What are the symptoms of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)? At first, you may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, your symptoms usually become more severe. They can include: Frequent coughing or a cough that produces a lot of mucus Wheezing A whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity Tightness in your chest Some people with COPD get frequent respiratory infections such as colds and the flu. In severe cases, COPD can cause weight loss, weakness in your lower muscles, and swelling in your ankles, feet, or legs. How is COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms A family history Various tests, such as lung function tests, a chest x-ray or CT scan, and blood tests Your doctor will diagnose COPD based on your signs and symptoms, your medical and family histories, and test results. What are the treatments for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)? There is no cure for COPD. However, treatments can help with symptoms, slow the progress of the disease, and improve your ability to stay active. There are also treatments to prevent or treat complications of the disease. Treatments include: Lifestyle changes, such as Quitting smoking if you are a smoker. This is the most important step you can take to treat COPD. Avoiding secondhand smoke and places where you might breathe in other lung irritants Ask your health care provider for an eating plan that will meet your nutritional needs. Also ask about how much physical activity you can do. Physical activity can strengthen the muscles that help you breathe and improve your overall wellness. Medicines, such as Bronchodilators, which relax the muscles around your airways. This helps open your airways and makes breathing easier. Most bronchodilators are taken through an inhaler. In more severe cases, the inhaler may also contain steroids to reduce inflammation. Vaccines for the flu and pneumococcal pneumonia, since people with COPD are at higher risk for serious problems from these diseases Antibiotics if you get a bacterial lung infection Oxygen therapy, if you have severe COPD and low levels of oxygen in your blood. Oxygen therapy can help you breathe better. You may need extra oxygen all the time or only at certain times. Pulmonary rehabilitation, which is a program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic breathing problems. It may include An exercise program Disease management training Nutritional counseling Psychological counseling Surgery, usually as a last resort for people who have severe symptoms that have not gotten better with medicines: For COPD that is mainly related to emphysema, there are surgeries that: Remove damaged lung tissue Remove large air spaces (bullae) that can form when air sacs are destroyed. The bullae can interfere with breathing. For severe COPD, some people may need lung transplant If you have COPD, it's important to know when and where to get help for your symptoms. You should get emergency care if you have severe symptoms, such as trouble catching your breath or talking. Call your health care provider if your symptoms are getting worse or if you have signs of an infection, such as a fever. Can COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) be prevented? Since smoking causes most cases of COPD, the best way to prevent it is to not smoke. It's also important to try to avoid lung irritants such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes, and dusts.

Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is called diastolic pressure. Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually the systolic number comes before or above the diastolic number. For example, 120/80 means a systolic of 120 and a diastolic of 80. How is high blood pressure diagnosed? High blood pressure usually has no symptoms. So the only way to find out if you have it is to get regular blood pressure checks from your health care provider. Your provider will use a gauge, a stethoscope or electronic sensor, and a blood pressure cuff. They will take two or more readings at separate appointments before making a diagnosis. Blood Pressure Category Systolic Blood Pressure Diastolic Blood Pressure Normal Less than 120 and Less than 80 Elevated 120 - 129 and Less than 80 High Blood Pressure Stage 1 130 - 139 or 80 - 89 High Blood Pressure Stage 2 140 or higher or 90 or higher Hypertensive Crisis (dangerously high blood pressure - seek medical care right away) Higher than 180 and Higher than 120 For children and teens, the health care provider compares the blood pressure reading to what is normal for other kids who are the same age, height, and sex. What are the different types of high blood pressure? There are two main types of high blood pressure: primary and secondary high blood pressure.: Primary, or essential, high blood pressure is the most common type of high blood pressure. For most people who get this kind of blood pressure, it develops over time as you get older. Secondary high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or use of certain medicines. It usually gets better after you treat that condition or stop taking the medicines that are causing it. Why do I need to worry about high blood pressure? When your blood pressure stays high over time, it causes the heart to pump harder and work overtime, possibly leading to serious health problems such as heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and kidney failure. What are the treatments for high blood pressure? Treatments for high blood pressure include heart-healthy lifestyle changes and medicines. You will work with your provider to come up with a treatment plan. It may include only the lifestyle changes. These changes, such as heart-healthy eating and exercise, can be very effective. But sometimes the changes do not control or lower your high blood pressure. Then you may need to take medicine. There are different types of blood pressure medicines. Some people need to take more than one type. If your high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or medicine, treating that condition or stopping the medicine may lower your blood pressure.

Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that's found in all the cells in your body. Your body needs some cholesterol to make hormones, vitamin D, and substances that help you digest foods. Your body makes all the cholesterol it needs. Cholesterol is also found in foods from animal sources, such as egg yolks, meat, and cheese. If you have too much cholesterol in your blood, it can combine with other substances in the blood to form plaque. Plaque sticks to the walls of your arteries. This buildup of plaque is known as atherosclerosis. It can lead to coronary artery disease, a condition in which your coronary arteries become narrow or even blocked. What are HDL, LDL, and VLDL? HDL, LDL, and VLDL are lipoproteins. They are a combination of fat (lipid) and protein. The lipids need to be attached to the proteins so they can move through the blood. Different types of lipoproteins have different purposes: HDL stands for high-density lipoprotein. It is sometimes called \"good\" cholesterol because it helps your body get rid of cholesterol. It carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Your liver then removes the cholesterol from your body. LDL stands for low-density lipoprotein. It is sometimes called \"bad\" cholesterol because a high LDL level leads to the buildup of plaque in your arteries. VLDL stands for very low-density lipoprotein. Some people also call VLDL a \"bad\" cholesterol because it too contributes to the buildup of plaque in your arteries. But VLDL and LDL are different; VLDL mainly carries triglycerides and LDL mainly carries cholesterol. What causes high cholesterol? The most common cause of high cholesterol is an unhealthy lifestyle. This can include: Unhealthy eating habits, such as eating lots of saturated fats. These fats are found in red meats, full-fat dairy products, chocolate, some baked goods, and many deep-fried and processed foods. Eating too much saturated fat can raise your LDL (bad) cholesterol. Lack of physical activity, with lots of sitting and little exercise. This lowers your HDL (good) cholesterol. Smoking, which lowers HDL cholesterol, especially in women. It also raises your LDL cholesterol. Stress, which may raise levels of certain hormones such as corticosteroids. These can cause your body to make more cholesterol. Drinking too much alcohol, which can raise your total cholesterol level. Genetics may also cause people to have high cholesterol. For example, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited condition that causes very high levels of cholesterol in the blood. Other medical conditions and certain medicines may also raise LDL cholesterol levels or lower HDL cholesterol levels. What can raise my risk of high cholesterol? A variety of things can raise your risk of high cholesterol: Age. Your cholesterol levels tend to rise as you get older. Even though it is less common, younger people, including children and teens, can also have high cholesterol. Sex. Between ages 20 and 39, men have a greater risk of high total cholesterol than women. But after menopause, a woman's risk goes up. This happens because menopause lowers levels of female hormones that may protect against high blood cholesterol. Family history. High blood cholesterol can run in families. Other health conditions. Conditions such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, HIV, and lupus can raise your risk of high cholesterol. Medicines. Certain medicines can raise your level of LDL cholesterol or lower your level of HDL cholesterol, including: Steroids Some chemotherapy medicines Medicines taken after an organ transplant Medicines for certain heart conditions Certain acne medicines Race or ethnicity. People from certain racial or ethnic groups may have an increased risk of high cholesterol. For example, Asian Americans are more likely to have high levels of LDL cholesterol than other groups. And non-Hispanic White people are more likely than other groups to have high levels of total cholesterol. Weight. Being overweight or having obesity raises your cholesterol level. What other health problems can high cholesterol cause? Undiagnosed or untreated high blood cholesterol can lead to serious health problems: If you have large deposits of plaque in your arteries, an area of plaque can rupture (break open). This can cause a blood clot to form on the surface of the plaque. If the clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow in a coronary artery. If the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle is reduced or blocked, it can cause angina (chest pain) or a heart attack. Plaque also can build up in other arteries in your body, including the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to your brain and limbs. This can lead to problems such as carotid artery disease, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease. How is high cholesterol diagnosed? There are usually no signs or symptoms that you have high cholesterol. A blood test can measure your cholesterol levels. When and how often you should get this test depends on your age, risk factors, and family history. The general recommendations are: For people who are age 19 or younger:: The first test should be between ages 9 to 11 Children should have the test again every 5 years Some children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of high blood cholesterol, heart attack, or stroke For people who are ages 20 to 65:: Younger adults should have the test every 5 years Men ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should have it every 1 to 2 years For people over age 65: They should be tested every year How can I lower my cholesterol? You can lower your cholesterol through heart-healthy lifestyle changes. They include a heart-healthy eating plan, weight management, and regular physical activity. If the lifestyle changes alone do not lower your cholesterol enough, you may also need to take medicines. There are several types of cholesterol-lowering medicines available, including statins. If you take medicines to lower your cholesterol, you still should continue with the lifestyle changes. Some people with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) may receive a treatment called lipoprotein apheresis. This treatment uses a filtering machine to remove LDL cholesterol from the blood. Then the machine returns the rest of the blood back to the person.

It is different from being overweight, which means weighing too much. The weight may come from muscle, bone, fat, and/or body water. Both terms mean that a person's weight is greater than what's considered healthy for his or her height. Obesity happens over time when you eat more calories than you use. The balance between calories-in and calories-out differs for each person. Factors that might affect your weight include your genetic makeup, overeating, eating high-fat foods, and not being physically active. Obesity increases your risk of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, and some cancers. If you have obesity, losing even 5 to 10% of your weight can delay or prevent some of these diseases. For example, that means losing 10 to 20 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds.

It can help people live longer and lower their risk of health problems like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and more. Good nutrition is about healthy eating. This means regularly choosing healthy foods and beverages. A healthy eating plan should give your body the energy and nutrients that you need every day. Nutrients include proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, minerals, and water. The plan should also take into account your preferences, cultural traditions, and budget. Healthy eating does not mean that you have to follow a very strict diet or eat only a few specific types of food. It doesn't mean that you can never eat your favorite foods. You can eat a variety of foods, including less healthy favorites. But it's important not to eat too much of those foods or have them too often. You can balance those foods with healthier foods and regular physical activity. The keys to a healthy eating plan include: Eating a variety of foods, including vegetables, fruits, and whole-grain products Eating lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, and low-fat dairy products Getting enough fiber Drinking lots of water Limiting salt, added sugars, alcohol, and saturated fat Making sure that you get enough nutrients, especially calcium, vitamin D, and potassium Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Start Here 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (Department of Agriculture; Department of Health and Human Services) Breaking Down Food: A Closer Look at What You Eat (National Institutes of Health) Also in Spanish MyPlate Food Guide (Nemours Foundation) Also in Spanish MyPlate.gov (Department of Agriculture) Nutrition.gov (Department of Agriculture) Also in Spanish Start Simple with MyPlate App (Department of Agriculture) Related Issues Aim for a Healthy Weight: Menus (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute) Dejunking Your Diet: The Drawbacks of Ultra-Processed Foods (National Institutes of Health) Also in Spanish Diet Choices to Prevent Cancer (American Academy of Family Physicians) Also in Spanish Diet in the News -- What to Believe?

There's no way around it; smoking is bad for your health. It harms nearly every organ of the body, even some that you would not expect. Cigarette smoking causes many cancers and other health problems. It is also the cause of nearly one in five deaths in the United States. Some of the many health problems that smoking can cause include: Cancers. Smoking is the most common cause of lung and oral cancers. But it can also cause cancer in many other parts of your body, such as in your larynx (voice box), esophagus, throat, bladder, kidney, liver, stomach, pancreas, colon and rectum, and cervix. It can also cause acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Lung diseases. Smoking is the most common cause of COPD. It can also worsen asthma and raise your risk of pneumonia. Cardiovascular diseases. Smoking can damage your blood vessels and make them thicken and grow narrower. This makes your heart beat faster and raises your blood pressure. Smoking also increases your risk of blood clots and stroke. Vision problems. Smoking can raise your risk of cataracts and cause macular degeneration (AMD). You have a greater chance of certain pregnancy problems if you smoke while pregnant. Your baby is also at higher risk of dying of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Smoking also causes addiction to nicotine, a stimulant drug that is in tobacco. Nicotine addiction makes it much harder for people to quit smoking. What are the health risks of secondhand smoke? Your smoke is also bad for other people. If they breathe in your secondhand smoke, they can get many of the same problems as smokers do. These problems can include heart disease and lung cancer. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have a higher risk of ear infections, colds, pneumonia, bronchitis, and more severe asthma. If you breathe secondhand smoke while pregnant, you're more likely to have preterm labor and a baby with low birth weight. Are other forms of tobacco also dangerous? Besides cigarettes, there are several other forms of tobacco. Some people smoke tobacco in cigars and water pipes (hookahs). These forms of tobacco also contain harmful chemicals and nicotine. Some cigars contain as much tobacco as an entire pack of cigarettes. E-cigarettes often look like cigarettes, but they work differently. They are battery-operated smoking devices. Using an e-cigarette is called vaping. Researchers still have a lot to learn about the health effects of using e-cigarettes. We do know that they contain nicotine, which is highly addictive and a health danger to you and your fetus if you are pregnant, children, and teens. And e-cigarettes also expose non-smokers to secondhand aerosols (rather than secondhand smoke), which contain harmful chemicals. Smokeless tobacco, such as chewing tobacco and snuff, is also bad for your health. Smokeless tobacco can cause certain cancers, including oral cancer. It also increases your risk of getting heart disease, gum disease, and oral lesions. Why should I quit? Remember, there is no safe level of tobacco use. Smoking even just one cigarette per day over a lifetime can cause smoking-related cancers and premature death. Quitting smoking can reduce your risk of health problems and add years to your life. The earlier you quit, the greater the benefit. Some immediate benefits of quitting include: Lower heart rate and blood pressure Less carbon monoxide in the blood (carbon monoxide reduces the blood's ability to carry oxygen) Better circulation Less coughing and wheezing Quitting smoking can be challenging, but it is so important for your health. Contact your health care provider if you need help quitting.

For most adults, moderate alcohol use is probably not harmful. Your risk of developing an alcohol use disorder (AUD) depends on how much, how often, and how quickly you drink alcohol. Alcohol misuse means that drinking causes distress and harm. Over time alcohol misuse can increase your risk of AUD. AUD can range from mild to severe, depending on the symptoms. Severe AUD is sometimes called alcoholism or alcohol dependence. AUD is a disease that causes: Craving - a strong need to drink Loss of control - not being able to stop drinking once you've started Negative emotional state - feeling anxious and irritable when you are not drinking What is binge drinking? Binge drinking is a type of alcohol misuse. It means drinking so much at once that your blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level is 0.08% or more. For a man, this usually happens after having 5 or more drinks within a few hours. For a woman, it is after about 4 or more drinks within a few hours. Not everyone who binge drinks has an AUD, but they are at higher risk for getting one. What are the dangers of too much alcohol? Too much alcohol is dangerous. Heavy drinking can increase the risk of certain cancers. It may lead to liver diseases, such as fatty liver disease and cirrhosis. It can also cause damage to the brain and other organs. Drinking during pregnancy can harm your fetus. Alcohol also increases the risk of death from car crashes, injuries, homicide, and suicide. How do I know if I have an alcohol use disorder (AUD)? You may have an AUD if you can answer yes to two or more of these questions: In the past year, have you: Ended up drinking more or for a longer time than you had planned to? Wanted to cut down or stop drinking, or tried to, but couldn't? Spent a lot of your time drinking or recovering from drinking? Felt a strong need to drink? Found that drinking - or being sick from drinking - often interfered with your family life, job, or school? Kept drinking even though it was causing trouble with your family or friends? Given up or cut back on activities that you enjoyed just so you could drink? Gotten into dangerous situations while drinking or after drinking? Some examples are driving drunk and having unsafe sex. Kept drinking even though it was making you feel depressed or anxious? Or when it was adding to another health problem? Had to drink more and more to feel the effects of the alcohol? Had withdrawal symptoms when the alcohol was wearing off? They include trouble sleeping, shakiness, irritability, anxiety, depression, restlessness, nausea, and sweating. In severe cases, you could have a fever, seizures, or hallucinations. If you have any of these symptoms, your drinking may already be a cause for concern. The more symptoms you have, the more serious the problem is. What should I do if I think that I might have an alcohol use disorder (AUD)? If you think you might have an AUD, see your health care provider for an evaluation. Your provider can help make a treatment plan, prescribe medicines, and if needed, give you treatment referrals.

Vaccines are injections (shots), liquids, pills, or nasal sprays that you take to teach your body's immune system to recognize and defend against harmful germs. For example, there are vaccines to protect against diseases caused by: Viruses, like the ones that cause the flu and COVID-19 Bacteria, including tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis What are the types of vaccines? There are several types of vaccines: Live-attenuated vaccines use a weakened form of the germ. Inactivated vaccines use a killed version of the germ. Subunit, recombinant, polysaccharide, and conjugate vaccines use only specific pieces of the germ, such as its protein, sugar, or casing. Toxoid vaccines use a toxin (harmful product) made by the germ. mRNA vaccines use messenger RNA, which gives your cells instructions for how to make a protein (or piece of a protein) of the germ. Viral vector vaccines use genetic material, which gives your cells instructions for making a protein of the germ. These vaccines also contain a different, harmless virus that helps get the genetic material into your cells. These vaccines may work in different ways, but they all spark an immune response. The immune response is the way your body defends itself against substances it sees as foreign or harmful. These substances include germs that can cause disease. What happens in an immune response? There are different steps in the immune response: When a germ invades, your body sees it as foreign. Your immune system helps your body fight off the germ. Your immune system also remembers the germ. It will attack the germ if it ever invades again. This \"memory\" protects you against the disease that the germ causes. This type of protection is called immunity. What are immunization and vaccination? Immunization is the process of becoming protected against a disease. But it can also mean the same thing as vaccination, which is getting a vaccine to become protected against a disease. Why are vaccines important? Vaccines are important because they protect you against many diseases. These diseases can be very serious. So getting immunity from a vaccine is safer than getting immunity by being sick with the disease. For a few vaccines, getting vaccinated can actually give you a better immune response than getting the disease would. But vaccines don't just protect you. They also protect the people around you through community immunity. What is community immunity? Community immunity, or herd immunity, is the idea that vaccines can help keep communities healthy. Normally, germs can travel quickly through a community and make a lot of people sick. If enough people get sick, it can lead to an outbreak. But when enough people are vaccinated against a certain disease, it's harder for that disease to spread to others. This type of protection means that the entire community is less likely to get the disease. Community immunity is especially important for people who can't get certain vaccines. For example, they may not be able to get a vaccine because they have weakened immune systems. Others may be allergic to certain vaccine ingredients. And newborn babies are too young to get some vaccines. Community immunity can help to protect them all. Are vaccines safe? Vaccines are safe. They must go through extensive safety testing and evaluation before they are approved in the United States. What is a vaccine schedule? A vaccine, or immunization, schedule lists which vaccines are recommended for different groups of people. It includes who should get the vaccines, how many doses they need, and when they should get them. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes the vaccine schedule. It's important for both children and adults to get their vaccines according to the schedule. Following the schedule allows them to get protection from the diseases at exactly the right time.

Germs are microorganisms. This means that they can be seen only through a microscope. They can be found everywhere - in the air, soil, and water. There are also germs on your skin and in your body. Many germs live in and on our bodies without causing harm. Some even help us to stay healthy. But some germs can make you sick. Infectious diseases are diseases that are caused by germs. The main types of germs are bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. How do germs spread? There are different ways that germs can spread, including: Through touching a person who has the germs or making other close contact with them, such as kissing, hugging, or sharing cups or eating utensils Through breathing air after a person with the germs coughs or sneezes Through touching the feces (poop) of someone who has the germs, such as changing diapers, then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth Through touching objects and surfaces that have germs on them, then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth From mother to baby during pregnancy and/or childbirth From insect or animal bites From contaminated food, water, soil, or plants How can I protect myself and others from germs? You can help protect yourself and others from germs: When you have to cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or use the inside of your elbow Wash your hands well and often. You should scrub them for at least 20 seconds. It is important to do this when you are most likely to get and spread germs: Before, during, and after preparing food Before eating food Before and after caring for someone at home who is sick with vomiting or diarrhea Before and after treating a cut or wound After using the toilet After changing diapers or cleaning up a child who has used the toilet After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing After touching an animal, animal feed, or animal waste After handling pet food or pet treats After touching garbage If soap and water are not available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol Stay home if you are sick Avoid close contact with people who are sick Practice food safety when handling, cooking, and storing food Regularly clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects Start Here About Handwashing (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) About Hygiene (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Germs: Understand and Protect against Bacteria, Viruses, and Infections (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research) Also in Spanish Hand Hygiene Frequently Asked Questions (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Your Body's Bugs: Nurturing Healthy Microbes (National Institutes of Health) Also in Spanish Prevention and Risk Factors Eight Ways to Guard Against Germs in Everyday Life (Cystic Fibrosis Foundation) - PDF Hand Washing: Do's and Dont's (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research) Also in Spanish Specifics Hand Sanitizer Facts (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Healthy Habits: Coughing and Sneezing (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) How to Make Water Safe in an Emergency (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) If Soap and Water Are Not Available, Hand Sanitizers May Be a Good Alternative (Food and Drug Administration) Also in Spanish Preventing Swimming-related Illnesses (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Also in Spanish Q&A for Consumers: Hand Sanitizers and COVID-19 (Food and Drug Administration) Also in Spanish Safely Using Hand Sanitizer (Food and Drug Administration) Also in Spanish Skip the Antibacterial Soap; Use Plain Soap and Water (Food and Drug Administration) Staying Safe in the Water: Guard Against Germs While Swimming (National Institutes of Health) Also in Spanish Clinical Trials ClinicalTrials.gov: Disinfection (National Institutes of Health) ClinicalTrials.gov: Hand Hygiene (National Institutes of Health) ClinicalTrials.gov: Hand Sanitizers (National Institutes of Health) ClinicalTrials.gov: Handwashing (National Institutes of Health) Journal Articles References and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine) Article: Reprocessing status of flexible bronchoscopes in 202 intensive care units in...

A stroke happens when there is a loss of blood flow to part of the brain. Your brain cells cannot get the oxygen and nutrients they need from blood, and they start to die within a few minutes. This can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death. If you think that you or someone else is having a stroke, call 911 right away. Immediate treatment may save someone's life and increase the chances for successful rehabilitation and recovery. What are the types of stroke? There are two types of stroke: Ischemic stroke is caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. This is the most common type; about 80% of strokes are ischemic. Hemorrhagic stroke is caused by a blood vessel that breaks and bleeds into the brain Another condition that's similar to a stroke is a transient ischemic attack (TIA). It's sometimes called a \"mini-stroke.\" TIAs happen when the blood supply to the brain is blocked for a short time. The damage to the brain cells isn't permanent, but if you have had a TIA, you are at a much higher risk of having a stroke. Who is at risk for a stroke? Certain factors can raise your risk of a stroke. The major risk factors include: High blood pressure. This is the primary risk factor for a stroke. Diabetes. Heart diseases. Atrial fibrillation and other heart diseases can cause blood clots that lead to stroke. Smoking. When you smoke, you damage your blood vessels and raise your blood pressure. A personal or family history of stroke or TIA. Age. Your risk of stroke increases as you get older. Race and ethnicity. African Americans have a higher risk of stroke. There are also other factors that are linked to a higher risk of stroke, such as: Alcohol and illegal drug use Not getting enough physical activity High cholesterol Unhealthy diet Having obesity What are the symptoms of stroke? The symptoms of stroke often happen quickly. They include: Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg (especially on one side of the body) Sudden confusion, trouble speaking, or understanding speech Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes Sudden difficulty walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination Sudden severe headache with no known cause If you think that you or someone else is having a stroke, call 911 right away. How are strokes diagnosed? To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will: Ask about your symptoms and medical history Do a physical exam, including a check of Your mental alertness Your coordination and balance Any numbness or weakness in your face, arms, and legs Any trouble speaking and seeing clearly Run some tests, which may include Diagnostic imaging of the brain, such as a CT scan or MRI Heart tests, which can help detect heart problems or blood clots that may have led to a stroke. Possible tests include an electrocardiogram (EKG) and an echocardiography. What are the treatments for stroke? Treatments for stroke include medicines, surgery, and rehabilitation. Which treatments you get depend on the type of stroke and the stage of treatment. The different stages are: Acute treatment, to try to stop a stroke while it is happening Post-stroke rehabilitation, to overcome the disabilities caused by the stroke Prevention, to prevent a first stroke or, if you have already had one, prevent another stroke Acute treatments for ischemic stroke are usually medicines: You may get tPA, (tissue plasminogen activator), a medicine to dissolve the blood clot. You can only get this medicine within 4 hours of when your symptoms started. The sooner you can get it, the better your chance of recovery. If you cannot get that medicine, you may get medicine that helps stop platelets from clumping together to form blood clots. Or you may get a blood thinner to keep existing clots from getting bigger. If you have carotid artery disease, you may also need a procedure to open your blocked carotid artery Acute treatments for hemorrhagic stroke focus on stopping the bleeding. The first step is to find the cause of bleeding in the brain. The next step is to control it: If high blood pressure is the cause of bleeding, you may be given blood pressure medicines. If an aneurysm if the cause, you may need aneurysm clipping or coil embolization. These are surgeries to prevent further leaking of blood from the aneurysm. It also can help prevent the aneurysm from bursting again. If an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is the cause of a stroke, you may need an AVM repair. An AVM is a tangle of faulty arteries and veins that can rupture within the brain. An AVM repair may be done through Surgery Injecting a substance into the blood vessels of the AVM to block blood flow Radiation to shrink the blood vessels of the AVM Stroke rehabilitation can help you relearn skills you lost because of the damage. The goal is to help you become as independent as possible and to have the best possible quality of life. Prevention of another stroke is also important, since having a stroke increases the risk of getting another one. Prevention may include heart-healthy lifestyle changes and medicines. Can strokes be prevented? If you have already had a stroke or are at risk of having a stroke, you can make some heart-healthy lifestyle changes to try to prevent a future stroke: Eating a heart-healthy diet Aiming for a healthy weight Managing stress Getting regular physical activity Quitting smoking Managing your blood pressure and cholesterol levels If these changes aren't enough, you may need medicine to control your risk factors.

If you feel pain and stiffness in your body or have trouble moving around, you might have arthritis. Any disorder that affects the joints is often called arthritis. Joints are places where two bones meet, such as your elbow or knee. Most types of arthritis can cause joint pain and inflammation (swelling). Over time, a swollen joint can become severely damaged. Some kinds of arthritis can also cause problems in your organs, such as your eyes or skin. Treatment will depend on the type of arthritis you have. What are the types of arthritis? Common types of arthritis include: Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis. It's often related to aging or injury. Autoimmune arthritis happens when your body's immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake. Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common form of this type of arthritis. Juvenile arthritis is a type of arthritis that happens in children. Infectious arthritis is an infection that has spread from another part of your body to the joint. Reactive arthritis is one type. Psoriatic arthritis affects people with psoriasis (itchy or sore scaly red and white skin patches). Gout is a painful type of arthritis that happens when too much uric acid builds up in your body. It often starts in the big toe. Other joints can also be affected. Ankylosing spondylitis is a type of arthritis of the spine that can cause stiffness and make it difficult to move and bend. What are the symptoms of arthritis? Pain, redness, warmth, and joint inflammation are common arthritis symptoms. You may not be able to move your joint as well as it should. Other symptoms could include fever, weight loss, breathing difficulties, or a rash. Symptoms often get worse as you age. Some symptoms of arthritis may be signs of other illnesses. Who is more likely to get arthritis? A few things that might increase your chance of getting arthritis include: Family history. You may be more likely to get certain types of arthritis if a member of your family has the disorder. Age. The risk of getting many types of arthritis increases with age. Sex. Certain types of arthritis are more common in women, while other types are more common in men. Other factors that might increase your risk of getting arthritis include having a previous joint injury, obesity, or lupus. How is arthritis diagnosed? To find out if you have arthritis, your health care provider may: Ask you about your medical history, including your symptoms. Do a physical exam. Order blood tests or take x-rays. Your provider may refer you to a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in arthritis care) for tests, diagnosis, and care. What are the treatments for arthritis? Treatment depends on the type of arthritis you have. It may include medicine or surgery. Your provider will work with you to improve your symptoms and quality of life.

Osteoporosis is a disease in which your bones become weak and are likely to fracture (break). The disease can develop when your bone mineral density and bone mass decrease. It can also happen if the structure and strength of your bones change. Osteoporosis is called a \"silent\" disease because it doesn't usually cause symptoms. You may not even know you have the disease until you break a bone. This could happen with any bone, but it's most common in the bones of your hip, vertebrae in the spine, and wrist. What causes osteoporosis? Your bones are made of living tissue. To keep them strong, your body breaks down old bone and replaces it with new bone. Osteoporosis develops when more bone is broken down than replaced. You lose bone mass and changes happen in the structure of your bone tissue. This can happen as you get older. Other risk factors can also lead to the development of osteoporosis or increase your chance of developing the disease. Who is more likely to develop osteoporosis? Anyone can develop osteoporosis, but you are more likely to develop it if you have one or more of risk factors: Your sex. Osteoporosis is more common in women. Your age. Your risk increases as you get older. It is most common in people over age 50. Your body size. It is more common in people who are slim and thin boned. Your race: White and Asian women are at highest risk. African American and Mexican American women have a lower risk. White men are at higher risk than African American and Mexican American men. Family history. Your risk of osteoporosis may be higher if one of your parents has osteoporosis or broke their hip. Changes to hormones. Low levels of certain hormones can increase your chance of developing osteoporosis. Diet. A diet that is low in calcium and/or vitamin D or does not include enough protein can raise your risk. Long-term use of certain medicines, such as: Corticosteroids Proton pump inhibitors (which treat GERD) Medicines to treat epilepsy Having other medical conditions, such as: Endocrine diseases Certain digestive diseases Rheumatoid arthritis Certain types of cancer HIV Anorexia nervosa, a type of eating disorder Your lifestyle. Certain lifestyle factors can contribute to bone loss, such as: Smoking tobacco Long-term heavy alcohol use Physical inactivity or prolonged periods of bedrest What are the symptoms of osteoporosis? Osteoporosis usually doesn't cause symptoms. You may not know that you have it until you break a bone. How is osteoporosis diagnosed? Health care providers usually diagnose osteoporosis during routine screening for the disease. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for: Women over age 65 Women of any age who have factors that increase the chance of developing osteoporosis The Task Force does not recommend regular screening for men. To find out if you have osteoporosis, your provider: Will ask about your medical history and whether you have ever broken a bone May do a physical exam, which could include checking for: A loss of height and/or weight Changes in your posture Balance and gait (the way you walk) Your muscle strength Will likely order a bone density scan What are the treatments for osteoporosis? The goals for treating osteoporosis are to slow or stop bone loss and to prevent fractures. Your provider may recommend: A healthy, balanced diet that includes enough calcium, vitamin D, and protein Lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking and limiting alcohol Regular physical activity Fall prevention to help prevent fractures Medicines, such as: Medicines that slow down bone loss Medicines that help rebuild bone In addition to managing your osteoporosis, it's important to avoid activities that may cause a fracture. These can include movements that involve: Twisting your spine, like swinging a golf club Bending forward from the waist, like sit ups and toe touches You can also help reduce the risk of breaking a bone by preventing falls. Can osteoporosis be prevented? To help keep bones strong and help prevent osteoporosis, the best thing to do is to eat a healthy diet rich in calcium and vitamin D. Getting regular physical activity, limiting alcohol, and not smoking can also help.

The seizures happen when clusters of nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain send out the wrong signals. People may have strange sensations and emotions or behave strangely. They may have violent muscle spasms or lose consciousness. Epilepsy has many possible causes, including illness, brain injury, and abnormal brain development. In many cases, the cause is unknown. Doctors use brain scans and other tests to diagnose epilepsy. It is important to start treatment right away. There is no cure for epilepsy, but medicines can control seizures for most people. When medicines are not working well, surgery or implanted devices such as vagus nerve stimulators may help. Special diets can help some children with epilepsy.

Asthma is a chronic (long-term) lung disease. It affects your airways, the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. When you have asthma, your airways can become inflamed and narrowed. This can cause wheezing, coughing, and tightness in your chest. When these symptoms get worse than usual, it is called an asthma attack or flare-up. What causes asthma? The exact cause of asthma is unknown. Genetics and your environment likely play a role in who gets asthma. An asthma attack can happen when you are exposed to an asthma trigger. An asthma trigger is something that can set off or worsen your asthma symptoms. Different triggers can cause different types of asthma: Allergic asthma is caused by allergens. Allergens are substances that cause an allergic reaction. They can include Dust mites Mold Pets Pollen from grass, trees, and weeds Waste from pests such as cockroaches and mice Nonallergic asthma is caused by triggers that are not allergens, such as Breathing in cold air Certain medicines Household chemicals Infections such as colds and the flu Outdoor air pollution Tobacco smoke Occupational asthma is caused by breathing in chemicals or industrial dusts at work Exercise-induced asthma happens during physical exercise, especially when the air is dry Asthma triggers may be different for each person and can change over time. Who is at risk for asthma? Asthma affects people of all ages, but it often starts during childhood. Certain factors can raise your risk of having asthma: Being exposed to secondhand smoke when your mother is pregnant with you or when you are a small child Being exposed to certain substances at work, such as chemical irritants or industrial dusts Genetics and family history. You are more likely to have asthma if one of your parents has it, especially if it's your mother. Race or ethnicity. Black and African Americans and Puerto Ricans are at higher risk of asthma than people of other races or ethnicities. Having other diseases or conditions such as obesity and allergies Often having viral respiratory infections as a young child Sex. In children, asthma is more common in boys. In teens and adults, it is more common in women. What are the symptoms of asthma? The symptoms of asthma include: Chest tightness Coughing, especially at night or early morning Shortness of breath Wheezing, which causes a whistling sound when you breathe out These symptoms can range from mild to severe. You may have them every day or only once in a while. When you are having an asthma attack, your symptoms get much worse. The attacks may come on gradually or suddenly. Sometimes they can be life-threatening. They are more common in people who have severe asthma. If you are having asthma attacks, you may need a change in your treatment. How is asthma diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose asthma: Physical exam Medical history Lung function tests, including spirometry, to test how well your lungs work Tests to measure how your airways react to specific exposures. During this test, you inhale different concentrations of allergens or medicines that may tighten the muscles in your airways. Spirometry is done before and after the test. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) tests to measure how fast you can blow air out using maximum effort Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) tests to measure levels of nitric oxide in your breath when you breathe out. High levels of nitric oxide may mean that your lungs are inflamed. Allergy skin or blood tests, if you have a history of allergies. These tests check which allergens cause a reaction from your immune system. What are the treatments for asthma? If you have asthma, you will work with your health care provider to create a treatment plan. The plan will include ways to manage your asthma symptoms and prevent asthma attacks. It will include: Strategies to avoid triggers. For example, if tobacco smoke is a trigger for you, you should not smoke or allow other people to smoke in your home or car. Short-term relief medicines, also called quick-relief medicines. They help prevent symptoms or relieve symptoms during an asthma attack. They include an inhaler to carry with you all the time. It may also include other types of medicines which work quickly to help open your airways. Control medicines. You take them every day to help prevent symptoms. They work by reducing airway inflammation and preventing narrowing of the airways. If you have a severe attack and the short-term relief medicines do not work, you will need emergency care. Your provider may adjust your treatment until asthma symptoms are controlled. Sometimes asthma is severe and cannot be controlled with other treatments. If you are an adult with uncontrolled asthma, in some cases your provider might suggest bronchial thermoplasty. This is a procedure that uses heat to shrink the smooth muscle in the lungs. Shrinking the muscle reduces your airway's ability to tighten and allows you to breathe more easily. The procedure has some risks, so it's important to discuss them with your provider.

It is made up of multiple layers of tissue. Your heart is at the center of your circulatory system. This system is a network of blood vessels, such as arteries, veins, and capillaries, that carries blood to and from all areas of your body. Your blood carries the oxygen and nutrients that your organs need to work properly. Blood also carries carbon dioxide to your lungs so you can breathe it out. Inside your heart, valves keep blood flowing in the right direction. Your heart’s electrical system controls the rate and rhythm of your heartbeat. A healthy heart supplies your body with the right amount of blood at the rate needed to work well. If disease or injury weakens your heart, your body’s organs will not receive enough blood to work normally. A problem with the electrical system — or the nervous or endocrine systems, which control your heart rate and blood pressure — can also make it harder for the heart to pump blood. brochure Explore some basic facts about keeping your heart healthy.

      "title": "HEART Guidelines: What Is Cardiovascular Disease",
      "content": "Cardiovascular disease can refer to a number of conditions: Heart disease Heart and blood vessel disease, also called heart disease, includes numerous problems, many of which are related to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a condition that develops when a substance called plaque builds up in the walls of the arteries. This buildup narrows the arteries, making it harder for blood to flow through. If a blood clot forms, it can block the blood flow. This can cause a heart attack or stroke. Heart attack A heart attack occurs when the blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked by a blood clot. If this clot cuts off the blood flow completely, the part of the heart muscle supplied by that artery begins to die. Most people survive their first heart attack and return to their normal lives, enjoying many more productive years. But having a heart attack does mean that you need to make some changes. The medications and lifestyle changes that your health care professional recommends may vary according to how badly your heart was damaged, and to what degree of heart disease caused the heart attack. Learn more about heart attack. Stroke An ischemic stroke, which is the most common type of stroke, occurs when a blood vessel that feeds the brain gets blocked, usually from a blood clot. When the blood supply to a part of the brain is cut off, some brain cells will begin to die. This can result in the loss of functions controlled by that part of the brain, such as walking or talking. A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel within the brain bursts. This is most often caused by uncontrolled high blood pressure. Some effects of stroke are permanent if too many brain cells die after being starved of oxygen. These cells are never replaced. The good news is that sometimes brain cells don’t die during stroke — instead, the damage is temporary. Over time, as injured cells repair themselves, previously impaired function improves. In other cases, undamaged brain cells nearby may take over for the areas of the brain that were injured. Either way, strength may return, speech may get better and memory may improve. This recovery process is what stroke rehabilitation is all about. Learn more about stroke. Heart failure Heart failure, sometimes called congestive heart failure, means the heart isn’t pumping blood as well as it should. Heart failure does not mean that the heart stops beating — that’s a common misperception. Instead, the heart keeps working, but the body’s need for blood and oxygen isn’t being met. Heart failure can get worse if left untreated. If your loved one has heart failure, it’s very important to follow their health care professional’s treatment plan. Learn more about heart failure. Arrhythmia Arrhythmia refers to an abnormal heart rhythm. There are various types of arrhythmias. The heart can beat too slow, too fast or irregularly. Bradycardia, or a heart rate that’s too slow, is when the heart rate is less than 60 beats per minute. Tachycardia, or a heart rate that’s too fast, refers to a heart rate of more than 100 beats per minute. An arrhythmia can affect how well your heart works. With an irregular heartbeat, your heart may not be able to pump enough blood to meet your body’s needs. Learn more about arrhythmia. Heart valve problems When heart valves don’t open enough to allow the blood to flow through as it should, a condition called stenosis results. When the heart valves don’t close properly and thus allow blood to leak through, it’s called regurgitation. If the valve leaflets bulge or prolapse back into the upper chamber, it’s a condition called prolapse. Discover more about the roles your heart valves play in healthy circulation. Learn more about heart valve disease. Common treatments Here are some common treatments for different types of cardiovascular disease: Heart valve problems Medications Heart valve surgery Arrhythmia Medications Pacemaker Electric cardioversion Catheter ablation Lifestyle changes Heart attack Medications Coronary angioplasty Coronary artery bypass graft surgery Heart transplant or other heart surgery Radiofrequency ablation Stent procedure Transmyocardial revascularization Lifestyle changes Stroke Medications Carotid endarterectomy (PDF)(link opens in new window) Thrombectomy Aneurysm clipping Coil embolization Blood transfusion Lifestyle changes Diagnostic tests, surgical procedures and medications In the hospital and during the first few weeks at home, your health care professional may perform several tests and procedures. These tests help them determine what caused the stroke or heart attack, and how much damage was done. Some tests monitor your progress to see if the treatment is working. Learn more about diagnostic tests and procedures. Learn more about surgical procedures that may have been performed at the hospital. Cardiac medications The medications prescribed after a cardiovascular event can aid in recovery and help prevent another heart attack or stroke. If you’re a caregiver, make sure your loved one takes their medications as directed and on time. Learn about the medications that your loved takes. Know what those medicines do, and what their goal is. It’s important to follow your health care professional’s directions closely, so ask questions and take notes. It’s important to follow your doctor’s directions closely, so ask questions and take notes. Learn more about cardiac medications.

      "title": "DIABETES Guidelines: Type 1",
      "content": "About Diabetes Understanding Type 1 Diabetes Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. Testing, coupled with education about diabetes symptoms and close follow-up, has been shown to enable earlier diagnosis and to prevent diabetes ketoacidosis. Image What is type 1 diabetes?When you have type 1 diabetes, your immune system mistakenly treats the beta cells in your pancreas that create insulin as foreign invaders and destroys them. When enough beta cells are destroyed, your pancreas can’t make insulin or makes so little of it that you need to take insulin to live. Insulin is a hormone that helps blood glucose (blood sugar) enter your body’s cells so that it can be used as energy. If you have diabetes, blood glucose can’t enter your cells so it builds up in your bloodstream. This causes high blood glucose (hyperglycemia). Over time, high blood glucose harms your body and can lead to diabetes-related complications if not treated.Most of the time, type 1 diabetes is diagnosed in young people, but it can develop in anyone at any age. Scientists and researchers today aren’t sure how to prevent type 1 diabetes or what triggers it.If you have type 1 diabetes, you can live a long, healthy life by having a strong support system and managing it with your diabetes care team. The treatment plan you develop with your diabetes care team will include insulin, physical activity, and an eating plan to reach your health goals.Type 1 Diabetes SymptomsIf you or your child have the following symptoms of diabetes, let your health care provider know. Symptoms include:Urinating oftenFeeling very thirstyFeeling very hungry—even though you are eatingExtreme fatigueBlurry visionCuts/bruises that are slow to healWeight loss—even though you are eating moreIt’s important to know when you first develop type 1 diabetes, you may not have any symptoms at all. Choose an option Children with Type 1 Diabetes Adults with Type 1 Diabetes Learning Your Risk for Type 1 Diabetes Why Learning Your Risk Helps Image Children with type 1 diabetes will usually have the symptoms listed above. If your child is potty-trained without issues at night starts having accidents and wetting the bed again, diabetes might be the reason.Even though it’s easy to diagnose a child with diabetes by checking their blood glucose at the doctor’s office or emergency room, the tricky part is recognizing the symptoms and knowing to take your child to get checked. If you’re a parent, it’s important to know that young children, including infants, can develop type 1 diabetes.Sometimes children can be in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) when they are diagnosed with diabetes. When there is a lack of insulin in the body, high levels of an acid called ketones can build up. DKA is a medical emergency that usually requires hospitalization and immediate care with insulin and IV fluids. Image When an adult develops type 1 diabetes, they are often mistakenly told they have type 2 diabetes. This may be from lack of awareness that type 1 diabetes can start at any age and in people of every race, shape, weight, and size. People with type 1 diabetes who also have the classic risk factors for type 2 diabetes—such as overweight/obesity, not being physically active, having high blood pressure, or are over age 35—are often misdiagnosed. It can also be tricky because some adults with new-onset type 1 diabetes are not sick at first. Their health care provider may find an elevated blood glucose level at a routine visit and starts them on diet, exercise, and an oral medication.Early detection and treatment of diabetes can decrease the risk of developing complications both at the time of diagnosis and in the future. By knowing and recognizing the symptoms above, you can learn if you have type 1 diabetes early and avoid complications, like diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Image Did you know?Type 1 diabetes doesn’t develop only in childrenThere have been recent advances in type 1 diabetes screening and treatmentIf you have a family history of type 1 diabetes, your health care provider may suggest screening for type 1 diabetes. They will order a blood test to measure your islet autoantibodies. The test results can go one of two ways:Negative: Your health care provider will retest you in the future.Positive: Even if you get a positive result, this doesn’t mean you have type 1 diabetes. Your health care provider will refer you to counseling about the risk of developing diabetes, diabetes symptoms, and DKA prevention. Additional testing as needed may be done to determine the course of your treatment. Image Even if you may not want to know if you, your children, or other family members are at risk for developing type 1 diabetes, there are benefits to knowing.First, you can learn more about the early warning signs of type 1 diabetes so you and your health care team can detect diabetes early—before DKA or severe illness develops. Because DKA can be life-threatening and early symptoms can be vague, knowing what to watch out for can help detect and treat DKA early or prevent it altogether.Second, there are emerging treatments and clinical trials that seek to delay the onset of type 1 diabetes in those who are at high risk. If you are at high risk for developing type 1 diabetes, it will be important to speak with an endocrinologist to learn whether these opportunities may be available and right for you. health care professionals Calling All Professionals The American Diabetes Association (ADA) convened leading experts, including endocrinologists, researchers, primary care professionals, certified diabetes care and education specialists, and mental health professionals, to understand opportunities and roadblocks to type 1 diabetes screening and awareness. The outcome of this roundtable is a report that outlines the discussion and potential opportunities for future direction. The report does not necessarily reflect official guidelines or recommendations from the American Diabetes Association or other participating organizations. Download Now Image The Honeymoon PhaseSome people with type 1 diabetes have a \"honeymoon\" period, a brief period of time where your body is producing enough insulin to lower blood glucose levels. The honeymoon phase usually happens after you start taking insulin and you may not need as much to manage your blood glucose. Work with your diabetes care team for treatment and care to avoid complications like hypoglycemia. A honeymoon period can last as little as a week or even up to a year. It’s important to know that the absence of symptoms doesn't mean the diabetes is gone. The pancreas will eventually be unable to make enough insulin, and, if untreated, the symptoms will return.Is it Possible You Don't Have Type 2 DiabetesIf you or someone you know is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes but isn’t able to manage it with the typical treatments for type 2 diabetes, it may be worth a visit to an endocrinologist to verify what type of diabetes you have. Generally, this requires antibody tests and possibly the measurement of a C-peptide level. It is important to be sure that your diagnosis is correct because that will determine your treatment plan, allowing you manage your diabetes and prevent its complications.

At first, your beta cells make extra insulin to make up for it. Over time, your pancreas can’t make enough insulin to keep your blood glucose at normal levels. Type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older adults but is increasing in young people.Treatment for people with type 2 diabetes will include healthy eating and exercise. However, your health care provider may need to also prescribe oral and injectable medications (including insulin) to help you meet your target blood glucose levels.Symptoms of Type 2 DiabetesThe following symptoms of diabetes are typical. However, some people with type 2 diabetes have symptoms so mild that they go unnoticed.Common symptoms of diabetes:Urinating oftenFeeling very thirstyFeeling very hungry—even though you are eatingExtreme fatigueBlurry visionCuts/bruises that are slow to healTingling, pain, or numbness in the hands/feet Early detection and treatment of diabetes can decrease the risk of developing the complications of diabetes.Although there are many similarities between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the cause of each is very different.

      "title": "PSYCHIATRY Guidelines: Depression",
      "content": "Depression Learn about depression, including symptoms, risk factors, treatment options and answers to your questions. ver en español Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, think, act, and perceive the world. Symptoms of depression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can appear differently in each person. These symptoms can include: Feeling sad, irritable, empty and/or hopeless. Losing interest or pleasure in activities you once enjoyed. A significant change in appetite (eating much less or more than usual) and/or weight (notable loss or gain unrelated to dieting). Sleeping too little or too much. Decreased energy or increased tiredness or fatigue. Increase in purposeless physical activity (e.g., inability to sit still, pacing, handwringing) or slowed movements and speech that are enough to be observed by others. Feeling worthless or excessively guilty. Difficulty thinking or concentrating, forgetfulness, and/or difficulty making minor decisions. Thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempts. Learn more Expert Q&A: Depression What is the difference between normal sadness or grieving and depression? Everyone experiences a range of emotions over the course of days and weeks, typically varying based on events and circumstances. When disappointed, we usually feel sad. When we suffer a loss, we grieve. Normally these feelings ebb and flow. By contrast, depression tends to feel heavy and constant. People who are depressed are less likely to be cheered, comforted or consoled. What does 'high-functioning depression\" mean? The term “high-functioning depression” underscores the reality that many individuals with depression face – going through the motions of their day to day lives, appearing normal on the surface, while silently struggling with symptoms of depression. However, it is critical to note that though this term has gained prominence on various social media platforms and may be helping to lessen the stigma of depression, it is not a specific medical diagnosis. Once a person has been diagnosed and treated for depression, is it likely to return? Among people who are treated for major depressive disorder and recover, at least half are likely to experience a recurrent episode sometime in their future.It is difficult to determine at what point this may occur or what circumstances, if any, may trdigger it. If a person experiences several episodes of major depression, a psychiatrist or other mental health professional may suggest long-term treatment. What kinds of treatments work for depression? A wide variety of treatments have been proven effective in treating depression. Some involve talking and behavioral change. Others involve taking medications. There are also techniques that focus on neuromodulation, which incorporates electrical, magnetic or other forms of energy to stimulate brain pathways. Examples of neuromodulation include electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), vagus-nerve stimulation (VNS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and deep-brain stimulation (DBS). The choice of therapy should be guided by the nature and severity of depression, past responses to treatment, and the preferences of the individual in treatment. What do I need to tell my doctor when discussing my feelings of depression? Total openness is important. You should talk to your healthcare professional about all of your symptoms, important milestones in your life and any history of abuse or trauma. Also tell your them about past history of depression or other emotional symptoms in yourself or family members, medical history, medications you are taking — prescribed or over-the-counter. It is also key to share how depression has affected your daily life and whether you have ever thought about suicide. How long should I wait before I go and see a medical professional? It is important to see a healthcare professional as soon as you notice significant changes in your mood, difficulties in your work/school or home life, or if those close to you have commented about any concerning changes in your mood, personality and/or behavior. More serious symptoms, such as suicidal thinking, require immediate attention. View More FAQs Author Chinenye Onyemaechi, M.D. .",

      "title": "PSYCHIATRY Guidelines: Anxiety Disorders",
      "content": "Learn about anxiety disorders, including symptoms, risk factors, treatment options and answers to your questions. Anxiety is a normal reaction to stress. Mild levels can be beneficial in some situations. It can alert us to dangers and help us prepare and pay attention. Anxiety disorders differ from normal feelings of nervousness or anxiousness and involve excessive fear or anxiety. Anxiety disorders are the most common of mental disorders and affect nearly 30 percent of adults at some point in their lives. Anxiety disorders can cause people into try to avoid situations that trigger or worsen their symptoms. Job performance, schoolwork and personal relationships can be affected. However, anxiety disorders are treatable with a number of psychotherapeutic treatments. Treatment helps most people lead normal productive lives. There are several types of anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, specific phobias, agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, and selective mutism. Learn more Expert Q&A: Anxiety Disorders What's the difference between normal anxiety and an anxiety disorder? It is normal for people to experience anxiety and have worries about different aspects of their lives. If you remember back to a time when you had a big exam or presentation, it is normal to feel nervous or on edge. The difference between normal anxiety and an anxiety disorder is when anxiety becomes persistent or recurrent, preventing you from full participation in life. Anxiety can range from relatively mild (occasional “butterflies,” jitteriness, accompanied by a sense of unease) to severe (frequent, disabling panic attacks). Severe anxiety disorders can lead someone to alter his or her lifestyle to accommodate the anxiety, for example avoiding activities. When anxiety begins to cause dysfunction in your daily life, that’s when it’s time to consider it’s more than normal anxiety. Can meditation or other relaxation techniques help with my anxiety? Relaxation techniques and meditation can certainly help with your anxiety. In fact, non-medication options are the first-line treatment for the mild anxiety that most of us experience from time to time. There are many books, online resources, and apps with relaxation exercises (often paired with deep breathing) and meditation guidance. They are relatively simple to learn, yet highly effective. These approaches can provide relief and can be used anywhere once the person understands the method. Mental health professionals can guide the person who needs a more personal approach to learning relaxation or meditation. Are there medications that can help with panic attacks? Yes. There are many medications that have FDA approval to treat anxiety disorders. For individuals who prefer medication, it is recommended to start with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). There is no evidence for any particular SSRI being better than another. This class of medications is not only helpful for panic attacks, but it’s also first-line treatment for generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, and social anxiety disorder. They can be quite effective and have few side effects, although it takes a few weeks to start noticing their benefit. In the past, benzodiazepines were commonly used to provide relief from anxiety. However, best practice today is to consider these medications when there’s been a partial response to an initial medication option. In these cases, a long-acting benzodiazepine is preferred. While these medications are effective, they should be used for short-term relief. They have many side effects, including drowsiness, and can be habit-forming at higher doses. People taking these medications should not use heavy machinery or drive until they understand how the medication might affect them. How are children with anxiety disorders treated? Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is indicated for all of the childhood anxiety disorders. Therapy alone can be an effective treatment for mild cases. For more moderate to severe anxiety, first-line treatment for children who require medication management for an anxiety disorder is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Are there any supplements that can help treat my child’s anxiety? While there are some supplements that may be considered for helping anxiety symptoms in children, it’s essential to consult with your physician before starting any new supplement regimen.

      "title": "Medicines used in the treatment of opioid dependence",
      "content": "Opioid dependence is a chronic condition that can lead to significant harm if left untreated. People who experience opioid dependence and the treatments themselves are highly stigmatised. Person-centred trauma-informed services are critical to therapeutic engagement and effectiveness. Buprenorphine and methadone are highly effective, evidence-based medicines for opioid dependence. In recent years, long-acting injectable buprenorphine has emerged as a safe and effective treatment option, offering flexible weekly or monthly dosing. The long-term treatment of opioid dependence can be undertaken in primary care settings. General practitioner and nurse practitioner prescribing, and community pharmacist dispensing, are essential for ongoing care. Australian jurisdictions have differing regulations that guide the prescribing of medicines for opioid dependence. Health professionals should be familiar with their local jurisdiction’s guidelines as well as the national guidelines. Drug and alcohol telephone services are available in each jurisdiction and can provide advice to health professionals. Opioid dependence is a chronic relapsing medical condition. According to the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases 11th revision (ICD-11), the diagnosis of opioid dependence has 3 main facets: loss of control, salience, and physiological factors of neuroadaptation (tolerance and withdrawal) ( Diagnosis of opioid dependence requires 2 out of 3 of the following: People can develop opioid dependence from illicit and pharmaceutical opioids, both prescribed and non-prescribed. Opioid dependence is a stigmatised condition. The experience of stigma and discrimination adversely affects health and prevents people from disclosing behaviours and accessing or staying in treatment. Opioid dependence treatment (ODT) with long-term prescribed opioids, such as buprenorphine or methadone, is highly effective and reduces the health, social and economic harms for people experiencing opioid dependence, In Australia, nearly 75% of ODT is provided in primary care settings. Most prescribers are general practitioners (GPs) with a small but increasing number of nurse practitioners (NPs). As ODT is highly effective, many people will greatly improve and can transition to ongoing treatment in primary care. Treatment in the primary care setting reduces stigma and enables better management of people’s general health care. A core role for primary care is the long-term management of people particularly whose ODT has stabilised. Ensuring good connections and collaboration between GPs, NPs, community pharmacists and local AOD specialist settings for consultation, advice and support, which may be virtual, is essential. Planned opioid withdrawal may be suitable for people who are using low doses of opioids (i.e. oral morphine equivalent daily dose less than 60 mg) or have a short history of opioid dependence (weeks to months); however, this approach is associated with a high risk of relapse and overdose due to loss of opioid tolerance. It is essential to consider the optimal setting for withdrawal for each person. People with other morbidities, experiencing homelessness or needing intensive psychological support, may do better in a supported setting, for example, in a public or non-government drug and alcohol inpatient unit. For support and more information, contact the AOD specialist advisory service in your jurisdiction. Medicines approved in Australia for the treatment of opioid dependence include methadone and buprenorphine ( ODT requires supervised medication administration (dosing). This can occur in drug and alcohol clinics, and in hospital or community pharmacies. Generally, people who commence oral or sublingual therapies will start with daily supervised dosing and be given doses to take away, to administer themselves at home, once they are stable in treatment. Stability is indicated by stable social conditions, stable physical and mental health, no high-risk drug use, attendance at planned appointments and good adherence to medication. Safe storage of takeaway medicines to prevent child poisoning is important. Generally, the choice of treatment should be a shared decision between the prescriber and the person seeking treatment, taking into account their unique needs, comorbidities, medications and preferences. Buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist, has a high affinity for opioid receptors and only partially activates them. This means that if a person with opioid dependence has high concentrations of opioid agonists (e.g. morphine, heroin) in their body, adding buprenorphine will displace the other opioid from the receptors, triggering opioid withdrawal symptoms (a condition called precipitated withdrawal). In contrast, if an opioid-dependent person presents with opioid withdrawal symptoms, buprenorphine will relieve these. Given the pharmacology of buprenorphine, care is needed to ensure that the person is in mild to moderate opioid withdrawal (COWS score of at least 10 to 15; refer to Appendix) before starting treatment to avoid precipitated withdrawal. Once above a certain daily dose, usually 16 mg, buprenorphine blocks the effects of other opioids, so it may be suitable for people who do not want to continue using other opioids. Buprenorphine may also assist with clarity of thought, making it a good option for those who need better cognitive function. Buprenorphine can be prescribed as a sublingual tablet or film and is usually combined with naloxone ( Long-acting injectable buprenorphine (LAIB) was first introduced in Australia in 2018. It is available as weekly or monthly subcutaneous injections. There are 2 formulations, with the trade names Buvidal and Sublocade ( Generally, sublingual buprenorphine+naloxone is started before transitioning the person to a LAIB. However, practice is evolving, and it is likely in the future that people may be started directly on a LAIB, with those who have not previously been exposed to buprenorphine receiving a test dose of sublingual buprenorphine+naloxone to exclude allergy prior to starting a LAIB. For further details on how to start LAIBs, refer to your jurisdiction’s guidelines. Methadone is a full opioid agonist ( There are 2 oral formulations of methadone: methadone syrup and Biodone liquid. Injected use is associated with infection and vein damage. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist with limited use in ODT. It may be used as adjunctive therapy in the maintenance of abstinence from opioids for people with a history of opioid dependence who have fully withdrawn from opioids. It has increased overdose risk and is not subsidised on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) for opioid dependence. Oral naltrexone is more commonly used in Australia for alcohol dependence relapse prevention. Like other opioids, methadone and buprenorphine can cause sedation, light-headedness, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, hypotension and, rarely, biliary or renal tract spasm. There is an increased risk of sedation and respiratory depression when methadone is used with other sedatives (e.g. benzodiazepines, alcohol). Buprenorphine is less sedating and is preferred if a particular risk of sedation exists. Methadone, and to a lesser extent buprenorphine, can cause QT interval prolongation, increasing the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. Therefore, methadone and buprenorphine must be used with caution, and electrocardiogram monitoring and AOD specialist advice sought when used in combination with other medications or substances that also prolongate the QT interval (e.g. alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines). Methadone and buprenorphine are both metabolised by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Medicines that induce or inhibit CYP enzymes (e.g. antiepileptics, steroids, antibiotics, nicotine, omeprazole, cimetidine) can result in under- or overdosing of methadone or buprenorphine. The impact of hepatic metabolism is less marked in buprenorphine and there appear to be fewer clinically relevant drug interactions with buprenorphine compared with methadone. ODT is long term, and for some, it is lifelong. Some people may wish to gradually stop treatment. This is best done when people have stable mental and physical health and are housed with good social connections and purpose. LAIBs may be preferred due to their long duration of action after the last dose which can mitigate the experience of withdrawal. Discharge planning should include advice and education around relapse prevention, overdose risk management, and follow-up as needed. There are ODT programs in every state and territory in Australia. These programs provide controlled supply of ODT under robust legal and regulatory frameworks to facilitate access to treatment and minimise unsanctioned supply and leakage into informal drug markets. The programs’ fundamental approach involves significant supervision of patient progress and medication administration. In some jurisdictions, there are state-funded services that focus on people presenting with complex issues (e.g. multimorbidity, polysubstance use, unstable mental and physical health) and provide free care by multidisciplinary teams. Policies, guidelines and training requirements vary between jurisdictions. Health professionals should refer to their local jurisdiction’s guidelines and requirements for prescribing and training ( Non-trained prescribers can provide care for up to 5 people. Training must be undertaken to become endorsed to prescribe for more than 5 people. Training:  Non-trained prescribers can provide care for up to 10 people stable on methadone and start or continue treatment for up to 20 people on buprenorphine. Accredited prescribers who have undertaken training can prescribe for 200 people. Training:  Three types of prescribers: full, shared care and temporary. Training:  Non-trained prescribers and nurse practitioners (in scope) can prescribe buprenorphine+naloxone formulations for up to 10 people. Training:  Training is needed to prescribe. Contact the  All medical practitioners and authorised nurse practitioners, supported by a  All prescribers must complete training to be able to prescribe for up to 50 people. Contact the  Community pharmacists and pharmacies are integral to ODT, providing 85% of ODT (supply, dispensing and administration) across Australia. Prior to July 2023, the cost of supplying, dispensing and administering ODT medicines in the community pharmacy setting was borne by the person in treatment. This typically costed between $120 and $210 per month. In July 2023, ODT medicines became part of the Section 100 Highly Specialised Drugs Program (Community Access) arrangements, allowing eligible people to pay the PBS co-payment for up to 28 days supply and a maximum of 5 repeats. Currently, there are no Medicare item numbers for LAIB administration for medical or nurse practitioners; however, pharmacists are able to claim fees for supplying ODT medicines and administering LAIBs under the  Each jurisdiction in Australia has drug and alcohol telephone services that can provide information, support and clinical advice in real time to health professionals ( Buprenorphine and methadone are highly effective, evidence-based treatments for people experiencing opioid dependence. Most people can be effectively managed by GPs and NPs working in primary care, while those with more complex needs may benefit from initial AOD specialist care and transfer to primary care once their complexity has settled. It can be highly rewarding work for the health professionals involved. Support and advice through local AOD specialist services and jurisdictional telephone lines are available. Health professionals should refer to jurisdictional regulations and guidelines when providing care. Access to treatment remains limited, and the engagement of GPs, NPs and pharmacists is crucial to ensure all who need it can receive treatment in the setting most suited to their needs. \n \n * The use of buprenorphine in planned withdrawal in the community setting generally needs to be authorised by the ODT program in each state and territory.",

The ligand PHY achieved a drug score of 0.81, binding affinity of −8.84 kcal/mol, ligand efficiency of 0.43, and inhibition constant (KI) of 10.8 nM, indicating it to be a potential ligand for developing antibiotics that target DHPS. Despite having weaker binding energy, PHY again demonstrated a lower KI value, indicating potential as a promising ligand for developing antibiotics targeting DHPS and TYRS [ TYRS are essential enzymes involved in protein synthesis. Its primary function is to catalyze the attachment of tyrosine to its respective tRNA molecule. TYRS is a crucial target for developing antimicrobial drugs because it plays a vital role in translating genetic information into proteins. Bacterial TYRS has distinct structural and functional characteristics compared to its eukaryotic counterparts, which scientists have utilized to develop specific inhibitors. These inhibitors can interfere with bacterial protein synthesis, reducing the growth or death of bacterial cells [ MD simulation was conducted to further investigate the structural stability, dynamic behavior, and interaction mechanisms of biomolecular complexes between the proteins: TYRS and DHPS and the ligand: PHY and OFL under physiological conditions.

      "title": "High prevalence of unrecognized chronic kidney disease in the Lolland-Falster Health Study: a population-based study in a rural provincial area of Denmark",
      "content": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 10–15% globally and is a marked independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Prevalence estimations are essential for public health planning and implementation of CKD treatment strategies. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and stages of CKD in the population-based Lolland-Falster Health Study, set in a rural provincial area with the lowest socioeconomic status in Denmark. Additionally, the study characterized participants with CKD, evaluated the overall disease recognition, including the awareness of CKD and compared it with other common conditions. Cross-sectional data were obtained from clinical examinations, biochemical analyses, and questionnaires. CKD was defined as albuminuria (urine albumin–creatinine ratio ≥30 mg/g), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m², or by a diagnosis in the National Patient Register. Patient awareness was assessed by self-reported CKD, and overall disease recognition by either a registered hospital diagnosis or self-reported CKD. Among 16 097 adults (median age 58.6 years), CKD prevalence was 18.0% (n = 2903), with 70.1% identified by albuminuria, 28.4% by reduced eGFR, and 1.5% by a registered diagnosis alone. Of those with CKD, 98.8% had stages 1–3 (eGFR ≥30 ml/min/1.73 m²), and 1.2% had stages 4–5 (eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m²). Female sex, comorbidities, smoking, and low socioeconomic parameters were independently associated with CKD. Patient awareness of CKD was 4.4%, compared to >50% for hypertension and >80% for diabetes, and the overall CKD recognition (self-reported or registered diagnosis) was 7.1%. Thus, in this population-based study, CKD was highly prevalent but poorly recognized, indicating great potential for preventing CKD progression and related complications. Additional content an author video to accompany this article is available at:  Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects over 10% of the global adult population, is becoming more prevalent and has emerged as the 11th leading cause of death [ Patients with CKD often have no or very few symptoms, leaving both the patients and clinicians unaware of the condition. This lack of awareness impedes timely intervention to prevent CKD progression and complications, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) [ In Denmark, stage 3–5 CKD prevalence is approximately 5% [ Denmark is a small high-income country with a population of approximately 5.9 million. Despite having a tax-funded healthcare system with free hospital access and relative genetic homogeneity within the population, health outcomes in Denmark vary considerably by region [ As part of LOFUS, the present cross-sectional study investigated the epidemiology of CKD. Unlike register-based studies, this study assessed CKD prevalence by systematic examination of albuminuria and decreased estimated GFR (eGFR), covering both early and late stages. Additionally, the study characterized participants with CKD and identified individuals who were unaware of their condition or unrecognized by the healthcare system. We hypothesized that the prevalence of CKD in Lolland-Falster was >10% and that the proportion of unrecognized CKD was >50%, thus representing a substantial public health issue contributing to the health disparities in the area. Randomly selected adults (≥18 years) were invited to participate in LOFUS together with members of their household, regardless of age [ Data on study participants’ contact with hospitals were collected from the Danish National Patient Register (DNPR), a nationwide hospital register providing longitudinal data on inpatient contacts since 1977 and outpatient and emergency department contacts since 1995 [ CKD was defined in accordance with Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) recommendations in terms of albuminuria (UACR above 30 mg/g) or eGFR below 60 ml/min/1.73 m Prevalent CVD was defined as a diagnosis of CVD, either self-reported (i.e. atherosclerosis, angina pectoris, deep vein thrombosis, or taking medication for atrial fibrillation) or listed in the DNPR. Blood pressure was measured using a standardized protocol, and the last of three consecutive measurements was used for evaluation [ Data on socioeconomic status were obtained from the questionnaire. The question regarding occupational status had 16 different response options. These were divided into the following four categories in the analyses:  Categorical variables are presented as proportions and continuous variables as means with standard deviations or medians with interquartile ranges. Since several participants were from the same household, generalized linear mixed-effects models with household as a random effect were used to account for this clustering and estimate !odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All tests were two-sided, and a  A total of 16 142 adults participated in LOFUS, but 45 participants were excluded due to missing data for both plasma creatinine and UACR. Therefore, 16 097 participants were included in the current study. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants are presented in  Demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants  Waist circumference ≥88 cm for women and ≥102 cm for men. Hypertension defined by either blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg, a registered diagnosis, or a self-reported diagnoses or use of antihypertensive medication. IQR, interquartile range; SD, standard deviation. Compared to the non-CKD group, individuals with CKD were older and had a higher prevalence of comorbidities ( The proportion of individuals with inactive occupational status was 60.3% in the CKD group and 33.4% in the non-CKD group. Most individuals in both groups had a short postsecondary education, whereas the proportion of individuals with no postsecondary education was slightly higher among those with CKD than those without. Results of univariate and multivariable analyses are presented in  Analyses of factors associated with CKD  \n \n \n Adjusted for age, sex, abdominal obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and smoking. Among the 2903 individuals with CKD, 4.4% ( Participants with CKD stratified by unrecognized/recognized  Not including the individuals with unspecified CKD stage. Hypertension defined by either blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg, a registered diagnosis, or a self-reported diagnosis or use of antihypertensive medication. In this population-based study, we found a CKD prevalence of 18.0%, predominantly based on the presence of moderately increased albuminuria. Over 90% of individuals with CKD were not previously hospital diagnosed or aware of their condition. The findings confirm our hypothesis that CKD represents a substantial but underrecognized public health concern in this rural provincial area of Denmark. Female sex, comorbidities including obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and CVD, as well as factors indicative of low socioeconomic status, were independently associated with CKD. We found a high prevalence of CKD compared to several other European countries. For example, the Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT) in Norway reported a CKD prevalence of 11.1% in the 2006–2008 cohort ( Regarding the prevalence of stage 3–5 CKD (5.1%) in our study, we noted similarities in other Scandinavian studies [ In our study, the proportion of individuals with recognized CKD was low (7.1%) but consistent with similar studies [ CKD is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular complications and mortality, even in its early stages with normal eGFR and low levels of albuminuria [ Consistent with prior research our findings also establish the significant association between CKD and low educational level, especially a lack of postsecondary education [ Our study was subject to certain limitations. First, because this was a cross-sectional study, we lacked repeated measurements of eGFR and UACR over time. Consequently, there was a risk of overestimating CKD prevalence based on transient decreases in eGFR and increases in UACR [ We report the largest and most comprehensive CKD prevalence study to date in Denmark, based not merely on register data but on systematic clinical and paraclinical examination of a randomly selected population. The data regarding albuminuria were almost complete, providing valuable information on the early asymptomatic stages of CKD, which is generally underrepresented in register-based studies. Moreover, previous population-based studies in Denmark were conducted on urban populations, whereas our study examines a rural provincial population. This unique feature of LOFUS enhances the generalizability of the findings by adding valuable insights from non-urban areas [ Most individuals with unrecognized CKD were identified based on the presence of moderately increased albuminuria. Therefore, it emphasizes the importance of testing for albuminuria, especially in high-risk groups such as those with diabetes, hypertension, and CVD, to timely detect individuals for whom initiation of treatment is indicated [ In this large population-based study, we found that CKD was highly prevalent, but most individuals were not aware of this condition and did not carry a hospital diagnosis, highlighting a substantial but hidden public health concern. Our findings reveal a great potential for preventing CKD progression and related complications in rural provincial areas of Denmark.",

      "title": "Periprosthetic Joint Infection: A Multifaceted Burden Undermining Arthroplasty Success",
      "content": "Despite advancements in surgical techniques and implant designs, Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) continues to be one of the commonest and most devastating causes of failure in total joint arthroplasty. PJIs are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, placing a multifactorial burden on patients, caregivers, surgeons, hospitals, health systems, and economies. The incidence of PJI ranges from 0.5% to 2.3% based on current literature. Mortality rates in PJI subsequent to a primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) range from 4% to 8% after one year. The common treatment for PJI is a two-stage revision THA, which itself is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The economic burden of PJI is substantial, with treatment costs 3 to 5.6 times higher than primary THA. Patients with PJI experience inferior hip function, lower health-related quality of life scores, and higher odds of developing new onset depression. PJI’s negatively impacts on a patient’s capacity to work and conduct everyday activities. Orthopaedic surgeons also face significant psychological stress due to the challenges in managing PJI, including feelings of incompetence, insecurity, and frustration. Continued research and innovation are essential to optimize THA outcomes and reduce the need for revision surgeries. Improved prevention strategies, multidisciplinary cooperation, and comprehensive care and support for both patients and surgeons are crucial. It is paramount that every orthopaedic surgeon remains cognisant of this complication to institute better prevention strategies, promote better multi-disciplinary cooperation and enhance patient pre-operative care.",

      "title": "A Review of the Role of Paraprobiotics in the Formulation of High-Protein Ice Cream as an Advanced Functional Food",
      "content": "Paraprobiotics are nonvital bacteria that have health benefits. Recently, they have been incorporated into dairy products as supplements to probiotics. The advantages of using paraprobiotics mainly include superior resistance to processing conditions, extended shelf-life, and safer consumption by people with weaker immune systems. In high-protein ice cream, paraprobiotics enhance freezing stability and eliminate the risks of microbial overgrowth and rare adverse effects. They also promote gut health, regulate immune responses, and have anti-inflammatory properties, which are important for children. Moreover, paraprobiotics enhance the functional value of high-protein ice cream by promoting gut health and immune support, making it an ideal functional supplement for athletes and bodybuilders. This review discusses recent developments in high-protein ice cream fortified with paraprobiotics, focusing on product stability, texture, and consumer acceptance while addressing challenges in the sensory quality of the final product. The concept of functional foods has its roots in long-standing traditions of health promotion through diet, dating back to thousands of years ago and evolving with advancements in science and technology. As the knowledge of food–human body interactions has grown, it has become evident that the nutritional and functional properties of certain foods can be enhanced by incorporating bioactive ingredients. High-protein ice cream fortified with paraprobiotics represents an innovative functional food promoting satiety, supporting muscle growth, and improving metabolism. However, the lactose, fat, and protein contents of traditional ice creams can pose challenges to individuals with lactose intolerance, milk protein allergies, or dietary restrictions [ Many dairy products, commonly used as carriers of probiotics, have unfavorable conditions for the survival of paraprobiotics. For instance, the high acidity of yogurt or thermal processes such as pasteurization and sterilization often result in a reduction or complete loss of viable probiotic cells [ Numerous clinical studies have been conducted on the use of paraprobiotics in dairy products, which can inform their application in high-protein ice cream. For example, a study on the yogurt containing the paraprobiotic  Additionally, another study indicated that daily consumption of the yogurt containing the inactivated cells of  Dairy products remain the primary carriers of probiotics and paraprobiotics; however, attention has recently shifted toward incorporating these ingredients into nondairy foods and supplements. This shift is driven by factors such as lactose intolerance, milk allergies, concerns about fat and cholesterol, vegetarian diets, and the presence of antibiotics and hormones in dairy products. Paraprobiotics have the advantage of high stability under various conditions and, unlike live probiotics, can be used in dry foods, beverages, and supplements without losing quality [ In a randomized controlled clinical trial by Barros et al. [ Paraprobiotics have also been used in nutritional supplements as alternatives to live probiotics, providing insights applicable to high-protein ice cream formulation. Studies have shown paraprobiotics can effectively enhance the immune system, lower inflammation, improve digestive system function, and alleviate the symptoms of stress and depression. These are the benefits that could enhance the functional properties of paraprobiotic-containing ice cream. For instance, supplementation with heat-inactivated  High-protein ice cream enriched with paraprobiotics is emerging as one of the most significant innovations in the food industry, owing to the growing demand for healthier functional foods. This innovation strikes a balance between the nutritional value and popularity of ice cream as a healthy snack [ The development of high-protein ice cream supplemented with paraprobiotics stands out as one of the most important innovations in the food industry, because of the growing demand for healthier functional foods. There is an increased health awareness related to functional foods which could help alleviate a number of health disorders associated with digestion, metabolic disorders, and immune system deficiencies. Paraprobiotics represent a new frontier of functional enrichment of foods. Owing to being viable, biologically active probiotics do not resist any of the issues associated with live microorganisms such as storage problems [ Paired with high-protein ice cream, paraprobiotics also enable the manufacturer to market a functional dessert supportive of muscle synthesis and metabolism, along with gut health and immune system function. This is rather important in the wake of increasing lactose intolerance and diets that avoid certain food components, as traditional ice cream contains fat and lactose, both of which decrease its acceptability. The paraprobiotics help in allaying these concerns by offering health benefits similar to those of live probiotics, without the strict storage conditions or any viability concern in variable temperature conditions [ More importantly, the development of paraprobiotic-enriched high-protein ice cream fits in with the current paradigm in combating chronic diseases like obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, all caused by dietary inputs. This functional ice cream with incorporated paraprobiotics further pushes the health-conscious customer paradigm for potential cholesterol reduction, gut microbiota management, and overall metabolic health [ While the formulation and benefits of such products will be analyzed, an effort is made to judge the role of paraprobiotics in converting a conventional convenience food into a health-promoting functional food. Until now, no application of paraprobiotics has been reported in ice cream formulation. This review is aimed at discussing the technologies related to paraprobiotic production, the formulation of high-protein ice cream, and the benefits of incorporating paraprobiotics into such ice cream. It also investigates the impacts of paraprobiotics on gut function and the immune system, ultimately positioning high-protein ice cream as a healthy functional food dessert for athletes. Paraprobiotics exhibit biological functions similar to live probiotics; nevertheless, since they are inactivated, they do not pose risks such as antibiotic resistance gene transfer and systemic infections. The immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties of paraprobiotics, such as those exhibited by  The potential of modulating immune responses and promoting the host health plays a crucial role in assessing the probiotic activity of bacterial strains. At the same time, the precise identification of the components of bacterial cells involved in immune cell interactions remains a challenge [ In a project performed by Taverniti et al. [ Paraprobiotics such as  The bacterial cell wall components, namely PGN, TA, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), significantly influence the biological activity of paraprobiotics. PGN, the major component of the cell wall in Gram-positive bacteria, consists of the polysaccharide chains of N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) linked by  The immunomodulatory activities of paraprobiotics are bidirectional; they can stimulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-2, IL-12, IL-8, TNF- TA and PGN in the cell wall of certain  The stimulation and modulation of the immune system by the cell wall components such as PGN in probiotics (viable microorganisms) and paraprobiotics (nonviable microbial components or lysates) occur through various mechanisms [ In a research project performed by Hatami et al. [ Retention of the gut barrier integrity plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses and reducing inflammation. The intestinal epithelial barrier prevents the direct contact between microbes and the gut cells via mechanisms like the mucus layer and the production of antibacterial molecules like regenerating islet-derived protein III-gamma (RegIII In addition, the vagus nerve–dependent inflammatory reflex also has a role in lowering inflammation by inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines. This mechanism involves the release of acetylcholine receptors and the activation of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( Studies have shown that paraprobiotics can diminish intestinal permeability by improving the expression of cell junction proteins such as claudin and occludin [ Isolation has an important role in understanding the health advantages of paraprobiotics as well as their modes of action. For separation, a variety of methods are employed, including techniques of cell disruption, heat treatment, freezing, drying, irradiation with gamma rays or UV light, high-pressure processing (HPP), and chemical treatment [ As an example of the thermal treatments listed in  Furthermore, it reversed the immunosuppressive effects of cyclophosphamide (CTX) by repairing splenic impairment and regaining the immune organ index. While IL-2 was decreased, the immune-related cytokines in the spleen and thymus elevated IL-1 The methods of cell membrane protein denaturation seem to represent the best approach for obtaining paraprobiotics. Treatment techniques often directly target the bacterial cell membrane and proteins. These techniques allow the degradation of the bacterial cell wall but preserve the integrity of major immunomodulatory components such as PGNs and fragments from the cell wall. According to Lee et al. [ Following the evaluation of inactivation methods for paraprobiotic production and their diverse health benefits such as immune system modulation and gut health enhancement, this section explores their application in high-protein ice cream, focusing on the resulting paraprobiotic properties and technological characteristics essential for functional food development. High-protein ice cream, as an innovative functional food, offers a suitable platform for the incorporation of paraprobiotics derived from probiotic strains such as  Thermal treatments, such as pasteurization at 60°C for 40 min or 80°C for 15 min, are suitable to inactivate  Nonthermal methods, including HPP (100–600 MPa) and high-intensity ultrasound (20 kHz, 792 W/cm Irradiation (gamma rays, 4–6.5 kGy) and chemical treatments (e.g., pH 1 or 12.5) are less suitable for high-protein ice cream, due to the significant degradation of PGN and EPS [ Supercritical carbon dioxide (8–30 MPa, 40°C) is effective on  The choice of inactivation method should balance the preservation of bioactive components, sensory quality, and industrial feasibility. Nonthermal methods like HPP and ultrasound are more suitable to produce high-protein ice creams containing paraprobiotics, because of their ability to preserve EPS, enhance texture, and improve sensory quality [ The high-protein ice cream discussed in this review is conceptualized as a functional carrier for paraprobiotics, formulated with 5%–7% fat (derived from cream and milk fat), 30%–35% solids-not-fat (SNF), including 15.02%–18.59% protein (sourced from milk protein concentrate (MPC) and whey protein isolate (WPI)), and 35%–40% total solids (TS) comprising sweeteners (e.g., sucralose) and stabilizers (e.g., guar gum). This composition was designed to ensure the stability of paraprobiotics during freezing and enhance nutritional value, aligned with findings on high-protein ice cream formulations [ Regarding protein sources, in order to achieve a target of 15% protein, 15% whey protein concentrate (WPC, 80% protein) alone is insufficient, as it contributes approximately 12% protein (15 × 0.8 = 12%) [ The role of paraprobiotics in the formulation of functional foods like high-protein ice cream is gaining attention, owing to their potential health benefits and technological advantages. Paraprobiotics derived from  Research on the effects of paraprobiotics, particularly their PGN components, has revealed significant benefits for intestinal function and disease treatment. PGN, which is a moiety of the bacterial cell wall, has a substantial effect on immune system stimulation even if the cell is nonviable. In the gut, they help modulate the immune response by PRRs, including TLRs, on the intestinal epithelium. This interaction enhances the generation of anti-inflammatory cytokines, which help maintain gut homeostasis and protect against inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) [ TAs account for as much as 50% of the dry weight of lactobacilli cell walls [ \n In addition to PGN, other cell wall components like polysaccharides also have a considerable effect on the functionality of paraprobiotics. Polysaccharides are commonly found on the surface of Gram-positive bacteria such as  Paraprobiotics have several key technological advantages over live probiotics, particularly in the formulation of high-protein ice cream, as they can be added to the ice cream without concerns for survival during processing, storage, and distribution. While live probiotics are susceptible to heat, high pressure, and acidic conditions, paraprobiotics remain stable and retain their functional properties under adverse conditions including high temperatures, HPP, low pH, and long storage times [ Furthermore, paraprobiotics enhance the functional value of food products by providing health benefits such as immune system modulation and gut health improvement, similar to live probiotics, but with greater stability. If viable probiotics are taken in wrong proportions, they will cause problems such as bacterial overgrowth or loss of viability during industrial processes [ Protein is a crucial macronutrient needed for tissue structures and the control of many physiological processes. In addition to providing approximately 4 kcal/g, protein is necessary for body growth. For men weighing about 65 kg, the recommended daily intake of protein is 54 g, and adjusting the protein intake based on individual needs is essential for optimal performance and recovery. Athletes typically require 1.2–2.0 g of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, depending on their training and goals [ High-protein ice creams with reduced sugar or sweetened with natural sweeteners serve as a dietary supplement for athletes and a potential dessert option for individuals with conditions like diabetes, provided the formulations meet low-glycemic requirements. The growing consumer interest in high-protein frozen desserts is evidenced by commercial products such as Breyer's Delights, Chilly Cow, Enlightened, Halo Top, and Skinny Cow, which are perceived to be healthier due to their elevated protein content, with milk protein, whey protein, and ultrafiltered milk being preferred over casein or plant-based proteins [ High-protein frozen desserts are recognized for meeting the nutritional needs of specific populations such as those requiring increased protein intake [ In this review, high-protein ice cream is defined as a type of ice cream containing approximately 15.05%–18.59% (wt.) protein based on experimental formulations utilizing WPI, which is significantly higher than that of traditional ice cream (typically 2.6%–4.6% wt.). This classification is supported by industry trends rather than specific regulatory standards, as no minimum protein content is mandated for this category by regulatory bodies like the FDA or EFSA, even though nutritional claims are governed by regulations such as EU No. 1924/2006 [ High-protein ice cream has gained popularity in recent years, with various protein sources employed to enhance its nutritional profile. The selection of protein ingredients significantly influences both the nutritional value and functional properties of the final product.  The literature highlights several key protein sources utilized in the formulation of high-protein ice cream. For example: (a) WPI: studies show that incorporating WPI significantly increases the ice cream protein content (up to 10%). This high-protein additive enhances texture and consistency, owing to its functional properties, but may negatively affect sensory attributes such as melt score due to elevating the matrix density [ (b) MPC: this ingredient has been shown to closely simulate the sensory properties of traditional ice cream while raising the protein content by approximately 5%–7% ( (c) MCC powder and MPC are recent additives. Membrane and ion-exchange technologies have enabled the manufacture of such specific high-protein compounds, most of which are employed as specialized additives and offer food functionality including solubility, viscosity, gelation, emulsification, and foaming [ (d) Plant-based proteins: owing to their enhanced oil and water binding capacities, PPI and SPI have been investigated as alternatives to dairy-based proteins, specifically WPI and MPC, in high-protein ice cream formulations. However, compared with these dairy proteins, PPI and SPI are less flavorful and creamy [ Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA), affecting 2%–6% of infants and 0.16%–0.49% of adults, may cause gastrointestinal distress or anaphylaxis, necessitating dairy-free formulations [ (e): WPC: it has been noted for its nutritional benefits and has been effectively applied to increase protein content while maintaining desirable physicochemical properties [ Recent studies have also focused on functional ice creams enriched with whey protein gels and blueberries which, respectively, give rise to protein content and bioactive compounds while improving health benefits [ In summary, while various protein combinations have been used to produce high-protein ice cream, the choice of the protein source markedly affects the sensory and physical properties of the product. However, a challenge remains in balancing the protein content with flavor and texture, especially when using plant proteins. Sivasankari et al. [ Functional dietary components help to naturally prevent illnesses including digestive disorders, obesity, high cholesterol, and diabetes. As a result, bioactive substances such as paraprobiotics are frequently employed to provide food with functional characteristics. Dairy products including ice cream and yogurt are among the best foods for imparting useful characteristics. The fat content of these products may readily be lowered and enhanced with bioactive substances [ \n The proteins used such as WPI, casein, and plant proteins like pea and soy, among others, are those that have been known to present benefits in muscle recovery, satiety, and nutrition enhancement in general. As proved by Salles et al. [ Conventional ice creams comprise low protein levels (2–5 wt.%), mainly derived from milk solids, that are insufficient to meet elevated nutritional demands. To address this, high-protein ice creams have been developed using protein powders such as WPI and MPC, achieving protein contents of 10%–18.59% (wt.). Although 10% (wt.) protein is commonly achievable in commercial formulations, experimental formulations in this review ( Inclusion of paraprobiotics in functional high-protein foods such as high-protein ice creams can be linked to their potential benefits in managing chronic diseases, for example, improving gut health and management of IBD. Dietary proteins and sugars in ice cream are formulated in a way that will ensure health in the digestive system or modulate the immune system to solve problems such as intestinal inflammation and metabolic syndrome [ Research has revealed the addition of bioactive compounds derived from probiotics to high-protein ice cream can affect textural properties (e.g., firmness, viscosity, and emulsion stability) and sensory attributes (e.g., taste, aroma, and mouthfeel). Due to their lack of need for viability in the final product, paraprobiotics can be a suitable option for products like ice cream, which are stored under freezing conditions where maintaining the survival of live microorganisms is challenging. Studies on probiotic ice creams have indicated that the inclusion of probiotics can result in a softer and more uniform texture while improving sensory acceptance. This effect is principally due to the production of EPS by probiotics, which act as emulsifying and stabilizing agents, thus reducing ice crystal sizes and enhancing creaminess [ The conceptualized formulation, with a TS content of 35%–40%, a high SNF content (30%–35%), and 10%–12% protein, was designed to enhance the melting resistance and structural integrity of high-protein ice cream. This composition, particularly the elevated protein content (10%–12%), contributed to the improved viscosity and stability of paraprobiotics within the frozen matrix, aligning with observations by [ Paraprobiotics have attracted noteworthy attention in the dairy industry for their potential applications as alternatives for traditional probiotics. Rather than presenting the idea of paraprobiotics, it will be put forward as well as the use of probiotics to gain added benefits [ Application of paraprobiotics in ice cream provides several advantages associated with stability, safety, and health promotion. In contrast to live probiotics, paraprobiotics are nonviable inactivated probiotic cells that can still produce health-promoting effects such as gut health improvement and immune system modulation. These features make them highly appropriate for ice cream where maintaining the viability of live probiotic bacteria is challenging under freezing conditions and during long-term storage. Their stability ensures that the added value of such preparations is retained in extreme conditions, making them ideal for frozen desserts. Although specific data on paraprobiotic cell density is limited, studies on probiotics suggest a minimum therapeutic threshold of 10 As explained by Szydłowska et al. [ In addition, paraprobiotics are not affected by storage conditions such as pH and temperature that normally influence the viability of living probiotic cells. This will ensure that the quality and health benefits of the products are maintained over time. The incorporation of paraprobiotics into ice cream gives the manufacturer an avenue to participate in the developing market of functional foods for health-conscious consumers seeking added health benefits to the basic nutrition [ Excessive intake may still occur in specific consumers, including athletes or individuals following high-protein diets, who may consume large quantities to meet their own nutritional goals, potentially increasing the risk of digestive discomfort [ The incorporation of live probiotics into ice cream has garnered attention for their potential health benefits; however, several studies highlight significant challenges related to the product quality and consumer acceptance, which paraprobiotic-containing ice creams are aimed at addressing. A primary issue is sensory modifications caused by the metabolites produced by probiotics. Probiotics generate organic acids such as lactic and acetic acids, particularly during fermentation, which can impart sour or vinegary flavors, lowering sensory acceptance. For instance,  Turkmen et al. [ Although certain probiotic metabolites, such as EPS produced by strains like  In contrast, paraprobiotics, being inactivated, do not ferment and thus avoid producing undesirable metabolites like organic acids or volatile compounds. This preserves the traditional ice cream sensory attributes, including sweetness and uniform texture. Moreover, paraprobiotics eliminate the risks of microbial overgrowth or rare complications associated with live probiotics, making them safer for consumers with compromised immunity [ Incorporating paraprobiotics into high-protein ice cream formulations represents a revolutionary approach to producing functional foods that combine sensory pleasure with health benefits such as improved gut health and immune system modulation. Unlike live probiotics, paraprobiotics exhibit superior stability during freezing and long-term storage, preserving functional properties like texture, viscosity, and emulsion stability, making them ideal for frozen desserts where the retention of live probiotics' viability is technologically challenging. Inactivation methods, such as mild thermal treatment (pasteurization at 60°C–80°C), HPP (100–600 MPa), and high-intensity ultrasound (20 kHz), play a critical role in preserving bioactive components like EPS. These methods enhance the ice cream texture, with thermal treatment increasing viscosity and firmness, HPP providing a softer texture and better resistance to ice crystal formation, and ultrasound creating a creamier mouthfeel and improved uniformity, all of which elevate sensory acceptance. The inactivated nature of paraprobiotics eliminates the risks of microbial overgrowth or rare adverse effects, enhancing safety for consumers with compromised immunity or at health risk. Furthermore, the addition of high protein content significantly enhances the nutritional value of ice cream, aligning with the growing consumer demand for healthier dessert options tailored to diverse dietary needs. WPI which is valued for its high protein purity, excellent solubility, texture enhancement, and nutritional benefits like muscle recovery and satiety and MPC which provides both casein and whey proteins for structural stability and enhanced nutritional value are optimal choices for these formulations. This review underscores the potential of high-protein ice cream containing paraprobiotics as an innovative functional food, highlighting the opportunities for further research to optimize the formulations, enhance sensory properties, and meet market demands.",

      "title": "Trends in smoking-attributable cardiovascular mortality in Germany",
      "content": "We quantified the fraction of cardiovascular deaths attributable to smoking in Germany over time, accounting for population ageing. We calculated population-attributable fractions to quantify cardiovascular deaths attributable to smoking for 1992 to 2021, and compared actual with age-standardized figures. We found a significant decline in the number of cardiovascular deaths attributable to smoking: from about 71 900 cases in 1992 to around 42 000 cases in 2021, with a steeper decline in men. Age-standardized figures suggest that population ageing partially offset this trend. Forward projections indicate increasing trends over the next decade. The results highlight the need for targeted smoking cessation programmes. Even though Germany has been rather reluctant to implement tobacco control policies aimed at sustainably reducing smoking compared to other European countries, smoking rates have steadily declined over the past three decades [ During the same period, improved diagnostic and treatment options have led to a gradual decrease in mortality rates from cardiovascular diseases [ This study aims to quantify the fraction of cardiovascular deaths attributable to smoking in Germany over time, taking population ageing into account. The goal is to assess the impact of declining smoking rates and demographic trends on the evolution of cardiovascular mortality. To calculate the number of cardiovascular deaths attributable to smoking, population-attributable fractions were used. This epidemiological metric reflects the proportion of deaths in a population that can be attributed to a risk factor. The calculation requires data on the prevalence of the risk factor in the population and the relative risk of mortality for diseases causally associated with the risk factor. Multiplying the population-attributable fractions with the number of deaths from these diseases yields the absolute number of deaths attributable to the risk factor. Data on smoking prevalence and mortality statistics from 1992 to 2021 were obtained from the Federal Statistical Office of Germany. Relative mortality risks for smoking-associated diseases were taken from the literature [ To assess the impact of population ageing on trends in cardiovascular deaths attributable to smoking, these numbers were compared with age-standardized figures, holding the age structure of 1992 constant (direct age standardization). To estimate the impact of population ageing on the future number of cardiovascular deaths attributable to smoking, a forward projection based on population forecasts from the Federal Statistical Office until 2035 was modelled, assuming that cardiovascular mortality rates would remain constant at 2021 levels and that current sex-specific smoking trends would continue. A similar approach has been previously applied for overall smoking-attributable mortality [ All absolute numbers were rounded to the nearest ten. Trends in smoking prevalence overall, and by sex and age group are shown in  The fraction of cardiovascular deaths attributable to smoking decreased over the observation period, from 17.3% in 1992 to 14.6% in 2021. However, there were sex-specific differences: a substantial decline in men (from 29.3% to 18.8%) and a slight increase in women (from 8.6% to 10.6%) (details not shown). When examining absolute numbers, the analysis showed a significant decline in the number of cardiovascular deaths attributable to smoking over the observation period: from about 71 900 cases in 1992 to around 42 000 cases in 2021. This decline was more pronounced in men than in women (men: reduction of about 24 800 cases; women: reduction of about 5100 cases) ( Estimated cardiovascular deaths attributable to smoking 1992–2021 in Germany, actual and age-standardized numbers. When examining the age-standardized numbers, an even more pronounced decline is observed, highlighting the impact of demographic changes on these trends. The differences between the actual and age-standardized figures were more marked in men than in women ( The forward projection of the number of cardiovascular deaths attributable to smoking suggests a slight increase for men, and a substantial rise for women of 37% by 2035 ( The results of this study indicate that cardiovascular mortality attributable to smoking has significantly decreased over the past three decades in Germany, although this trend has been partially offset by opposing demographic trends due to population ageing. The substantial reduction in absolute numbers seems to be mainly driven by the overall decline in cardiovascular mortality rates, while decreasing smoking rates might only play a secondary role. The results further suggest that over the next years, population ageing could halt or even reverse the decline in the number of cardiovascular deaths attributable to smoking observed in recent decades. This underscores the urgent need for tobacco control policies and targeted interventions to promote smoking cessation to reduce the disease burden caused by smoking. A recent study on life expectancy in Germany particularly highlights the importance of increasing efforts in cardiovascular risk management and prevention. It shows that Germany lags behind other high-income countries in life expectancy, which is primarily due to higher mortality rates among older adults and those nearing retirement age, largely driven by cardiovascular diseases [ Several limitations must be considered when interpreting the results of this study. First, the calculations rely on self-reported data on smoking behaviour, and on mortality statistics from the German Federal Statistical Office. Although these data sources are generally considered reliable, there is potential for inaccuracies and biases that could affect the precision of the estimates presented here. Second, the forward projection to 2035 assumes constant mortality rates and a continuation of recent smoking trends, which may not hold true in reality, and the results should therefore be interpreted with caution. Third, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an increase in overall mortality, with numerous direct and indirect impacts on cardiovascular mortality [ Nevertheless, these results provide valuable insights into the trends in cardiovascular mortality attributable to smoking in Germany and highlight the importance of targeted smoking cessation programmes to reduce cardiovascular mortality, particularly in middle-aged and older age groups. Lastly, there is also an urgent need to implement proven effective tobacco control policies to reduce smoking and promote smoking cessation.",

      "content": "Clinicians frequently encounter cases of multiple valvular heart disease, wherein the combination of stenotic or regurgitant lesions occurs on separate cardiac valves [ Patients who demonstrated rheumatic involvement of the AV following MV intervention for rheumatic MS or MR, which encompassed MV replacement (MVR), percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty (PMBV), and any other forms of MV intervention such as ringed annuloplasty at Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital between December 1st, 2008 and December 31st, 2023, were included. For patients who underwent multiple MV interventions, we considered the first intervention as the criteria for data collection. Three patients who had their initial MV intervention at another hospital were also included. Those who underwent concurrent or bygone intervention on the AV or lacked echocardiographic follow-up exceeding one year were excluded. Two clinicians specializing in echocardiography determined whether the AV disease had a rheumatic etiology. The severity grading of cardiac valve disease adhered to current echocardiography guidelines [ In cases of AS, severity was assessed based on echocardiographic measurements, including maximal transaortic velocity ( Defining severe AS remains somewhat elusive. In this study, we considered a case to be presumed severe AS if it met at least one of the three classical criteria:  The study protocol conforms to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki [ Statistical analyses were performed using R (Version 4.3.1, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). A total of 890 patients who underwent MV intervention for rheumatic MS or MR without concurrent AV intervention were initially screened for eligibility. Among them, 76 patients had AV involvement of rheumatic etiology and fulfilled the inclusion criteria of our study ( Mechanical MV was applied to 54 patients without any complications, except for one case that experienced unexpected cardiac arrest with successful resuscitation within a month of the surgery. Nine patients received a bioprosthetic MVR. Among them, one patient required a redo-MVR due to a tissue valve tear, while another patient underwent redo-MVR along with AV replacement (AVR) due to infective endocarditis. Ringed mitral annuloplasty was performed for one patient with severe MR. Out of the 12 cases who underwent PMBV, one underwent PMBV twice before requiring MVR, one case (Patient A, detailed below) underwent double valve replacement (DVR) for both the AV and MV after two PMBV procedures, and one case underwent MVR along with coronary artery bypass graft surgery nine years after PMBV due to unstable angina. Postoperative changes in AS severity, as compared to preoperative grades based on parameters such as AV  A 33-year-old female with severe MS was referred to our institution for PMBV as she was planning for pregnancy. The procedure was successfully performed, and she had a stable delivery. After a 7-year gap in follow-up, she returned with dyspnea and underwent a redo PMBV, which yielded suboptimal results. Postprocedural echocardiography confirmed persistent severe MS with moderate MR (II/IV). Her AV parameters were  A 66-year-old female underwent mechanical MVR and tricuspid valvuloplasty for severe MS and moderate TR. At the time of surgery, her AV profile showed Vmax 3.0 m/s, mPG 19 mmHg, and AVA 1.0 cm A 60-year-old female underwent tissue MVR, tricuspid annuloplasty, and Maze operation for severe MS, TR, and AF at another hospital. Eighteen years later, she developed infective endocarditis requiring a redo DVR and repeat maze operation. Her last stable echocardiogram before surgery showed  A 43-year-old female with severe MS underwent PMBV at another hospital before transferring to our institution for follow-up. At 66 years, she underwent mechanical MVR, tricuspid valvuloplasty, and Maze operation. Five years postoperatively, her AV profile was  A 51-year-old female underwent PMBV for severe MS. At that time, her AV profile was  A 49-year-old female underwent mechanical MVR for severe MS. At the time, her AV profile was  Notably, four (Patients C, D, E, and F) of the six cases were classified as having paradoxical LFLG severe AS, meeting criteria of AVA < 1.0 cm There were no instances where postoperative AR severity progressed to severe; changes in severity grading are depicted in  Consequently, three out of the 76 patients underwent AVR, whose AV disease category was classified as severe AS. In the group predominantly affected by severe MS for MV intervention, 16 showed deterioration of AS and only three demonstrated improvements. Among this group, 14 cases experienced an improvement in AR severity, while 15 exhibited an increased amount ( AF was newly diagnosed in 19 cases after MV intervention. Among them, 10 had undergone a Maze operation for AF previously, while the remaining nine cases developed de novo AF. Seven out of the nine cases with de novo AF were detected during the follow-up period after PMBV. There was one reported death among the 76 cases. Clinical events during follow-up are presented in  AS initiates damage in the left ventricle (LV) and may also lead to right ventricular injury, posing a risk of sudden cardiac death for the patient [ Diagnosing severe AS is a complex task and more so in the LFLG severe AS category. In our study, four cases (Patients C, D, E and F) are classified as having paradoxical LFLG severe AS despite normal EF category. This suggests a potential true-severe AS. While AVA, as an anatomical factor, indicates severe AS, the hemodynamic parameters, which lack sensitivity, do not fall within the high specificity range [ The timing of AV assessment after MV intervention is a crucial factor. Generally, LV function and remodeling recover within the first year after MV intervention, at which point the AV can be evaluated in a stable condition [ Invasive methods offer an alternative means to overcome the limitations of transthoracic echocardiography in grading AS severity. However, they present technical challenges and rely on a multitude of assumptions [ The optimal timing for valve intervention in the paradoxical LFLG severe AS remains unclear. Proper management may involve addressing the potential impact of concurrent heart failure with preserved EF by treating hypertension and carefully monitoring the detrimental effects of AS on LV filling pressure, rather than focusing solely on AVA. Until further elucidation, general medical therapy for heart failure appears to suffice [ Regarding perioperative risk, it is inappropriate to directly compare MVR alone and DVR, given their distinct patient baseline comorbidities, which can vary from center to center. However, when examining mortality rates, DVR appears to have an overall 5-year mortality ranging from 5% to 20%, while MVR with or without tricuspid valvuloplasty demonstrates a relatively lower value [ As observed in this study, patients with rheumatic cardiac valve disease tend to be younger than those with degenerative cardiac valve disease and may opt for mechanical prosthetic valves to avoid the need for repeat replacement. Patients with dual mechanical valves face a higher risk of thrombosis and are recommended to maintain a higher target international normalized ratio [ There is no established lower threshold of mPG for mild AS. In our study, the same population was categorized into both the mild AS and no AS groups when sorted according to AV Vmax and AVA criteria. Consequently, an mPG of 14 mmHg was proposed as the lower limit cutoff for mild AS. Among 18 patients whose preoperative assessment showed mild AS, five progressed to moderate AS, while one deteriorated to severe AS after four years of follow-up. Three out of nine patients who were assessed to have moderate AS at preoperative evaluation showed progression to severe AS after the median follow-up period of seven years (mean nine years). It is poorly understood why the patient with mild AS showed even more rapid progression to paradoxical LFLG severe AS than the moderate AS patients. Looking at the changes in AS and AR severity in  LVEF and LVWT significantly increased over time, while tissue Doppler early diastolic velocity ( Overall, 3.4–10.3% of patients with rheumatic involvement at AV develop severe AS with a substantial portion in the form of paradoxical LFLG severe AS, and few of them exhibit severe AR during the median follow-up period of five to six years after MV intervention. Our study has several limitations that need to be acknowledged. First, it is retrospective and observational in nature, which may introduce inherent biases. In addition, the presence of a substantial amount of missing data and a relatively short median follow-up period are important considerations. Focusing on patients with follow-up periods of over a year introduces potential survival bias, which should be taken into account when interpreting the results. Moreover, our study design does not allow us to make definitive conclusions about whether delaying AV intervention leads to improved clinical outcomes, especially in concerned patient groups. Identifying the specific factors contributing to patients falling into the paradoxical severe AS category and assessing whether patients undergoing MVR with rheumatic AV involvement are more susceptible to paradoxical severe AS were challenging. A larger sample size and further investigation may shed light on these aspects in future studies. The absence of long-term secondary prophylaxis with antirheumatic antibiotics represents another limitation of our study. This was primarily due to the low number of patients who started regular follow-ups before the age of 40 and the significant pain associated with benzathine penicillin G injections, even when mixed with lidocaine. Paradoxically, however, this lack of prophylaxis enabled us to more accurately demonstrate the natural progression of rheumatic heart disease. In conclusion, only a small portion of rheumatic AV involvement progresses to severe AS after MV intervention, and performing MV intervention for severe MS or MR in patients with concurrent mild or moderate AS or AR due to rheumatic changes is considered safe.",

      "title": "Remote Monitoring of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Using Digital Health Technologies",
      "content": "Current care and research pathways for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) primarily rely on regularly scheduled visits to specialized centers. These visits provide intermittent clinical information to health care professionals and require patients to travel to the clinic. Digital health technologies enable continuous data collection directly from the patient's home, bringing new opportunities for personalized, timely care and a refined assessment of disease severity in clinical trials. In this review, we summarize the state of the art in digital health technologies for remote monitoring of patients with ALS, ranging from televisits through videoconferencing to sensor-based wearable devices. We explore how these technologies can benefit clinical care and advance treatment development. Despite significant progress, real-world adoption of these technologies remains limited. An overview is provided of the key barriers hindering their widespread implementation and the opportunities to advance the field. Significantly, there is an urgent need for harmonization across stakeholders through consensus guidelines and consortia. These efforts are essential to accelerate progress and harness the full potential of digital health technologies to better meet the needs of patients. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by its highly heterogeneous presentation of phenotypes and progression rates. Digital health technology (DHT) may overcome these challenges and improve care delivery. DHT is “a system that uses computing platforms, connectivity, software, and/or sensors, for health care and related uses,” Navigating DHTs from inception to adoption can, however, be a complex and demanding journey, the evidence to support their use in practice being still in its infancy. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies that implemented DHTs in ALS. In August 2024, we searched the PubMed database using search terms including “amyotrophic lateral sclerosis” or “motor neuron disease” combined with various terms to describe DHT. Studies were eligible if they met the following criteria: (1) enrolled at least 10 patients with ALS and (2) investigated a DHT to remotely monitor patients. Studies that solely evaluated a DHT in an in-clinic setting were excluded. We refer to eAppendix 1 (eTable 1 and eFigure 1) for a detailed description of our search strategy and screening procedure. In total, we screened 1,675 citations, of which 77 studies are identified and summarized in  The number of studies that investigated digital health technologies to remotely monitor patients with ALS, categorized into televisiting, self-administered online surveys, objective tools, and telehealth platforms (A). An overview of the tools used for objective measuring (B) and their outcomes (C). For illustrative purposes, no more than 30 outcomes per category were depicted. ALS = amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; DTW = dynamic time warping; EIM = electrical impedance myography. Created in BioRender. van Unnik J (2025)  Although televisits have long been part of routine care, the pandemic led to a tremendous global uptake, resulting in a plethora of reports on how clinical visits could be decentralized. Televisits allow the health care provider to collect and act on synchronous information through a “live” connection to assess the patient's health status. Although the phone could be used to assess the patient's health status, for example, by phone-administered ALS Functional Rating Scale–Revised (ALSFRS-R), Only 1 retrospective study was identified that investigated the safety and quality of televisits Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) have emerged as important remote measurement tools, offering a low-burden method to monitor symptoms, daily function, and quality of life, without the need for evaluator training. The self-administered versions of the ALSFRS-R were most frequently investigated and used either a smartphone application or web portal. The surveys were developed in 4 different languages and compared against an evaluator-administered ALSFRS-R, either in-person, by telephone, or by video call. While excellent inter-rater and intra-rater reliability were consistently reported, several studies demonstrated a small positive bias with patients reporting higher scores compared with trained evaluators. In addition, the self-reported Patient-Ranked Order of Function (PROOF) was developed to reflect that patients might perceive some ALSFRS-R domains to be more important than others. PROOF weighs the domains according to a self-reported order of importance, demonstrating excellent test-retest reliability and potential refinement of the ALSFRS-R total score. Remote monitoring of bulbar symptoms typically involves the measurement of speech by eliciting specific tasks using a smartphone application or a web-based platform. Initially, these technologies only acquired voice samples, but more recent applications also allow for video recordings of the facial musculature, thereby enabling a multimodal assessment including acoustic, linguistic, and orofacial characteristics. Elicitation methods were largely similar between studies, although the total number of tasks varied substantially. Frequent tasks included reading passage (short story), diadochokinesis task (quick repetition of sequel of syllables), reading speech (structured sentences), and picture description. Outcomes derived from voice samples typically outperformed those based on video recordings in distinguishing abnormal from normal ALSFRS-R speech scores. Significantly, no study thoroughly investigated patient acceptability or burden of remote speech function assessment. Considerable attrition rates were reported occasionally, questioning the feasibility of long-term monitoring, particularly in later stages of the disease. While many studies reported slope differences between patients with and without bulbar involvement as measured by novel outcomes, longitudinal relationships of these outcomes with current clinical standards, including functional, disability, and survival outcomes, were rarely investigated, highlighting the need for additional validation steps. In addition, the influence of cognitive decline on measured speech outcomes remains to be elucidated as it could affect outcomes derived from both structured and unstructured elicitation methods. Although muscle weakness is the hallmark of ALS and has been widely used as an outcome in clinical trials, remote monitoring of muscle strength has received relatively little attention. Studies have used portable devices with integrated dynamometers to monitor hand grip Electrical impedance myography (EIM) offers a potential alternative to traditional muscle strength assessment, which may be suitable for remote monitoring because of the portability of the device and relatively low measurement complexity. Remote monitoring of physical mobility has commonly been conducted using commercially available or research-graded wearables equipped with an accelerometer. These body-worn devices may collect data passively during everyday life or actively during tasks evoking specific movements. Nearly all studies derived outcomes from passively collected data. These outcomes reflected various constructs, ranging from what a patient can do (capacity) to what the patient actually does in day-to-day life (performance). An overview of the outcomes and their relations with ALS functional measures is illustrated in  Mobility outcomes were grouped into main categories (e.g., “calories” and “metabolic equivalent of task” were grouped under “energy expenditure”) and stratified by either fine or gross motor function (dark green headings) to demonstrate their associations with key ALS outcomes (gray headings). Although a wide variety of mobility outcomes, devices, and wear locations were investigated, most studies solely explored the relationship with the ALSFRS-R using limited sample sizes. The relationship with other key ALS outcomes remains to be quantified, illustrating that additional validation beyond proof-of-concept is warranted before widescale implementation is possible. ALS = amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; ALSFRS-R = ALS Functional Rating Scale–Revised; A = ankle; C = chest; H = hip; S = smartphone; W = wrist. Remote monitoring and adjustment of ventilator oxygen flow is one of the earliest applications of DHTs in ALS. No studies have investigated the feasibility and validity of these assessments in patients with advanced bulbar involvement, which remains a significant unresolved challenge. In addition, while some studies have demonstrated that these technologies may lead to a more rapid prescription of noninvasive ventilation Autonomic dysfunction has been observed in patients with ALS, potentially leading to changes in cardiac function. Heart rate and blood pressure have been found to be predictive for future ALSFRS-R scores. In summary of the above, patients and health care professionals may thus benefit substantially from DHTs, which could positively affect the delivery of care. The reality is, however, that the evidence of most technologies has not yet matured sufficiently and the care provision of today largely continues with traditional periodic visits. Beyond clear evidence of clinical benefit of DHT, successful integration of these technologies in existing pathways is critical for their adoption. Leah, a 62-year-old woman, received the ALS diagnosis 2 years ago. Since first symptom onset, she has been coping with the relentless progression of the disease. A few months ago, she experienced some shortness of breath while performing activities, which is perhaps the reason why she joined a pilot program to monitor her respiratory function at home that supplemented usual care. Since then, Leah has been self-assessing her vital capacity using home-based spirometry and monitoring for orthopnea using a self-administered survey. Data were communicated to the ALS center through a telehealth platform that is accessible on her smartphone. After 6 months, her vital capacity declined and Leah messaged through the telehealth platform that she started to have trouble breathing during the night. She was promptly referred to a pulmonologist, and NIV was initiated shortly thereafter. ALS = amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; NIV = noninvasive ventilation. Although pilot programs have affirmed the wielding capabilities of telehealth platforms to potentially benefit current ALS care, these studies have also exposed several challenges to translating their promise into practice. Fostering interoperability to allow seamless dataflows between DHTs, electronic health care systems, and patient portals is a vital task While DHTs have been linked to potential cost reductions, As evidence of DHTs continues to mature, the uptake of these technologies is likely to spread and diversify beyond the occasional use of televisits. Telehealth platforms combined with DHT-derived outcomes offer health care providers insights into the health status of patients that extend far beyond the current model, facilitating more personalized, timely care. Moreover, the growing amount of data collected from future observational studies will bring new opportunities to further enhance clinical decision making, for example, by developing models using accelerometry data that predict the time to wheelchair dependency or loss of ambulation. Despite the enormous interest for DHTs in clinical drug development, their implementation remains limited to only a few clinical trials (e.g.,  Instead, a more comprehensive approach is required. In the near future, digital outcomes could support measures such as neurofilament levels and electrophysiologic markers to capture early treatment signals and refine phase 2 to 3 decision making. At some time in the future, one might imagine DHT-derived outcomes replacing their respective ALSFRS-R subdomain counterparts, allowing for objective, detailed, and remotely collected outcome measures that can be tested in hierarchical order to demonstrate efficacy in clinical trials. Alternatively, one could combine these different measures—both clinically and statistically—into a single, composite end point to reflect the overall response to treatment. To establish how best to undertake this approach would be an interesting challenge. Such a digital surrogate—combined with definite end points such as survival—allows for data flow optimization to enhance operational efficiencies. In summary, the field has grown significantly in recent years, resulting in a vast array of technologies to monitor patients, as highlighted by this review. Although some variety in technological solutions is essential to encompass all aspects affected by ALS, much of the research has focused on developing new outcomes while targeting the same disease aspect. This has yielded an abundance of small, proof-of-concept studies with limited evidence to support their use in real-world practice. At the same time, there are several disease aspects that have received limited attention despite being perceived as important by patients, such as fatigue and cognition. A collaborative approach, with the development of consensus guidelines and standards, streamlines the generation of evidence required to support DHTs in real-world practices, encompassing proof of validity, reliability, clinical relevance, and clinical benefit. In addition, there is an unrealized opportunity to increase the value of DHT-generated data, which, at present, are typically isolated from the broader research community. Opt-in clauses for data sharing, without compromising patient privacy, incorporated in new and existing protocols could enable data aggregation in digital registries and large international databases, similar to current efforts aimed at unraveling the genetic basis of ALS. Several initiatives are already underway, such as the ALS Research Collaborative and PRECISION ALS, As the regulatory and reimbursement landscape continues to evolve, alternative pathways may become increasingly accessible to alleviate current challenges in generating evidence of cost-effectiveness for digital technologies, for example, by using flexible reimbursement models and collection of real-world data. Although most DHTs were deemed feasible and well tolerated by patients, follow-up durations were limited and the suitability of these technologies to monitor patients during more advanced disease stages or increasing cognitive impairment remains largely unproven. Moreover, special attention should be aimed at engaging diverse and lower digitally literate patients to increase accessibility and prevent exacerbating existing health disparities, Still, the uptake of DHTs may largely depend on their successful integration in existing research and care pathways. While the pharmaceutical industry could lead the effort by adopting DHTs as explanatory end points in clinical trials, implementing these technologies in routine care may be more complicated, in part because of the required reimbursement by health insurance companies and interoperability with existing infrastructure. Nevertheless, while significant challenges remain unsolved, the adoption and coverage of DHTs to remotely monitor patients have been steadily increasing, allowing us a glimpse into the future on how these technologies may better serve the needs of patients. These knowledge gaps and challenges hindering the uptake of DHTs in the clinical practice of today, and the potential solutions to facilitate their use in the care and research of tomorrow, are summarized in  Current Knowledge Gaps, Challenges, and Potential Steps Toward Increased Use of Digital Health Technologies in Real-World Practice Abbreviations: ALS = amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; ALSFRS-R = ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised; DHT = digital health technology. In conclusion, the use of DHTs has the potential to reshape our care and research pathways. This transition has, to date, not yet fully transpired, and only a few technologies are being used in selected settings, while the provision of care largely continues with regular, in-clinic visits. This is mainly driven by uncertain cost-benefit assessments, limiting perpetual use of DHTs beyond the initial pilot or outside a research context. For drug development, none of the outcomes derived from DHTs has been comprehensively validated and their added value in capturing clinical meaningful information is largely unknown. Given the limited evidence to date, the possibility also remains that these technologies are ineffective and add unnecessary burden, complexity, and expense. Nevertheless, seeking harmonization among all stakeholders through consensus guidelines and consortia is required to fully realize the potential of DHTs to better meet the needs of patients living with this devastating disease.",

      "title": "The Relationship Between Social Media Use Purposes, Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors, and Metabolic Parameters in Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes",
      "content": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic disease characterized by insufficient insulin production, typically occurring during childhood or adolescence. This condition can directly affect many metabolic parameters and healthy lifestyle behaviors that impact an individual's quality of life [ Social media, in addition to being a tool that enhances social interactions among young people, also plays a significant role in acquiring and sharing health information. It has been determined that the level of trust in social media has a meaningful and positive effect on acquiring health information in digital environments [ However, it is believed that social media use is not limited to information acquisition, but can also affect individuals' lifestyles and health behaviors. A study conducted by Hygen et al. [ The purposes of social media use in adolescents with T1D emerge as an important factor in health management. The NutriWalking app, developed by Hartzler et al. [ Consequently, the relationship between the purposes of social media use and healthy lifestyle behaviors and metabolic parameters in adolescents with T1D is a complex issue that requires a multidisciplinary approach. Social media is considered an important tool for adolescents in acquiring health information, establishing social interactions, and developing healthy lifestyle behaviors. Therefore, increasing research in this area will allow us to better understand the relationships between social media use and diabetes management in adolescents. Additionally, it is crucial for pediatric nurses, within their roles in protecting and promoting child health, to identify potential issues and plan nursing interventions. These nurses not only treat diseases but also take on the responsibility of protecting children's physical and mental health by promoting healthy lifestyles. In this context, identifying the relationship between the purposes of social media use, healthy lifestyle behaviors, and metabolic parameters in adolescents with T1D will shed light on diabetes management for nurses, parents, and adolescents. This research is designed as a descriptive and cross-sectional study to determine the relationship between the purposes of social media use, healthy lifestyle behaviors, and metabolic parameters in adolescents with T1D. The study used purposive sampling method. Adolescents who were aged between 11 and 18 years, were diagnosed with T1D mellitus and were residing in Gaziantep were included in the study. Adolescents who submitted incomplete and incorrect data (13 people) were excluded from the study. The informed consent form for the research was electronically sent to the adolescents and their parents via a Google Forms link, and their consent was obtained. The researchers distributed the questionnaire and the scales, prepared on the electronic environment, to social media (WhatsApp) groups of the adolescents who agreed to participate in the study between 1 and 30 September 2023. The adolescents were asked to voluntarily complete the questionnaire forms. A post-power analysis was done to calculate the sample size. A power of 99% and an effect size of 0.4 were calculated. Based on the post hoc analysis, it was determined that the sample size ( An adolescent descriptive information form, the Scale of Social Media Use Purposes (SSMUP), the Social Media Addiction Scale (SMAS), and the Adolescent Lifestyle Profile (ALP) were used as data collection tools in the study. This is a 15-item form prepared by the researchers upon literature review [ The scale developed by Solmaz et al. [ The scale, developed by Günüç [ Hendricks, Murdaugh, and Pender conducted the validity and reliability study of the scale in 2006. The scale makes it possible to assess the healthy lifestyle behaviors of adolescents. Ardıç and Esin [ In the study, scale scores and metabolic parameters (HbA1c and fasting glucose level) were the dependent variables and sociodemographic questions were the independent variables. The data were analyzed with strict adherence to confidentiality principle and no bias took place. The data were analyzed in the SPSS 29 software confidentially. The data were analyzed using descriptive data such as number, percentage, mean and standard deviation (SD), and statistical methods such as  The approval was obtained from university ethics committee (Decision No. 2023-30 dated 01/08/2023) in order to conduct the study. The adolescents and parents who participated in the study were informed about the purpose and process of the study through the Google Form. The researcher obtained the authors' permission via e-mail to use the scales. No personal data was collected in the Google Form. This section of the study will analyze the findings obtained from 108 adolescents diagnosed with T1D mellitus who were voluntary to participate in the study. It was determined that 58.3% of the adolescents were female, 88.9% had a nuclear family, 65.7% were in their early adolescence period, 50.9% had a family income less than expenses, and 25% had problems with their parents ( In the study it was found that 23.1% of adolescents used the information they learned from social media to treat their diabetes. The social media platforms on which they learned information were Instagram (59.3%), YouTube (38.9%), and WhatsApp (28.7%), respectively. A total of 49.1% of the adolescents spent 121 min and more on social media daily ( \n \n A significant relationship was found between social media addiction and HbA1c levels, one of the metabolic parameters of adolescents ( This study was conducted to examine the relationship between the purposes of social media use, healthy lifestyle behaviors, and metabolic parameters in adolescents with T1D. It was observed that there was a positive and significant correlation between social media addiction and social media use purposes. This suggests that social media use purposes lay the groundwork for social media addiction. Individuals use social media platforms for many purposes, including communication with others, accessing news, browsing the internet, preparing for educational activities, seeking information related to their treatments, and engaging in leisure activities [ A significant negative correlation was observed between social media addiction and interpersonal relationships. Social media addiction impairs face-to-face communication skills negatively [ It is observed that there is a significant positive relationship between the purposes of social media use and physical activity. It facilitates self-management of behaviors related to physical activity and quality of life in adolescents who use social media to get information about exercises [ A significant positive correlation was observed between social media use and a healthy diet. Access to information about nutrition quality on social media appears to facilitate the regulation of behaviors associated with diet quality [ A significant positive correlation was observed between social media use purposes and interpersonal relationships. Adolescents use social media in interpersonal interactions. Older adolescents use social media to communicate and interact with others more than their younger counterparts. As the internet and social media use of adolescents rises, their use of social media for interpersonal interactions and their social media addiction also increases [ It is observed that social media addiction has a significant relationship with HbA1c values and fasting blood glucose levels. It has been reported that adolescents change their treatment routine and cause poor glycaemic control as they spend time on internet browsing, video gaming, and social media platforms until midnight [ There are some factors that impose limitations on the generalizability of the findings presented herein. First, the data were collected via Google Forms rather than face-to-face interviews. Second, we lack information regarding adolescents who refused to participate in the questionnaire. Moreover, since the study was conducted in a single province, it may not be possible to generalize the results to a wider population. As a result of the research, it was found that interpersonal relationships are negatively associated with social media addiction. The purposes of social media use were positively associated with physical activity, healthy eating, and interpersonal relationships. It was also determined that social media addiction has a negative relationship with the metabolic parameters (HbA1c values and fasting blood glucose levels) of adolescents with T1D. Social media use purposes affect healthy lifestyles. Creating social media content suitable for managing diabetes in adolescents with T1D mellitus (T1DM) and organizing trainings on the positive and negative effects of social media use by pediatric nurses can provide adolescents with access to correct health information and achieve optimal metabolic parameters. The study suggests that adolescents with social media addiction may suffer from interpersonal communication problems. Close follow-up of social media use and interpersonal communication in adolescents who are socially isolated due to chronic illness and early intervention in possible deviations by nurses can protect and improve their health. Determining social media use in adolescents with T1D will contribute positively to adolescent and public health.",

Shift work increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, dysautonomia, digestive diseases, metabolic syndrome, and obesity, endangering the physical and psychological health of nurses [ Among nurses, shift work is not only related to sleep disturbance but also to psychological symptoms, job stress, and family care responsibilities [ Low-level light therapy (LLLT) can produce a photobiomodulation (PBM) effect using red light (630–700 nm) and near-red light (700–1100 nm) to irradiate the human body. The proposed mechanism is that photons dissociate inhibitory nitric oxide from enzymes, leading to an increase in electron transport, mitochondrial membrane potential, and ATP production. Another proposed mechanism concerns the activation of light-sensitive ion channels, allowing calcium to enter the cell. After the initial photon absorption events, numerous signaling pathways are activated through reactive oxygen species, cyclic AMP, NO, and Ca One study recruited participants with general anxiety who were asked to self-administer 830 nm light therapy for 20 min a day for 8 weeks; the results showed a significant improvement in anxiety scores and sleep quality [ Shift-work nurses show sleep difficulty and psychological symptoms, which may be associated with changing circadian rhythms. In addition, the impact of shift work is long-lasting and not limited to workdays [ This study was an unblinded two parallel-group randomized controlled trial. The study participants were shift-work nurses working in a medical center in Taipei, Taiwan, recruited from July 2021 to June 2022. The inclusion criteria were nurses who participated in a 4-week shift work schedule in the last 6 months and had self-reported insomnia with Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores ≥ 9. We excluded those with a history of head surgery and who were pregnant. The study participants were recruited through posters, line groups, and the first author's personal network in the study hospital. The eligible participants were informed of the study's purpose and that participation in the study involved committing themselves to 12 measurements in the 4-week study period. All participants signed a written consent form. Block randomization with a block size of four was used to randomize the study participants into intervention or control groups. Combinations of the assignments were placed in six opaque envelopes. The study participants were given a serial number. Before study initiation, a researcher unsealed the envelopes and assigned participants accordingly. The required sample size was estimated by G Power 3.1 based on repeated measures with an effect size of 0.2, Type 1 error of 0.05, and power of 0.8, resulting in a required sample size of 42. Since this study involved multiple measures, to account for expected attrition, we aimed to recruit at least 30 participants per group. In total, 64 participants were recruited, with 32 in the intervention group and 32 in the control group. As participants were informed of the commitment needed for participation, all participants completed the study. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Taipei Veterans General Hospital (IRB no. 2021-06-010C). A portable Meridian Aura Cap (MAC) (I-Tai, Ministry of Health Medical Devices No. 005077; Top Union Globaltek INC, Hsinchu City, Taiwan) equipped with low-level LED light was used to provide red and near-infrared light (660 and 850 nm) irradiation for 30 min, three times a week for 4 weeks. The MAC was designed using eight soft bands and an optical power maximum of 10 W. Irradiation sites covered the meridians and head acupoints: Baihui (GV20), Shentíng (GV24), Touwei (ST8), Jiaosun (SJ20), Fengchi (GB 20), and Fengfu (DU16). The invention patent number is I702067 (Republic of China, Taiwan). The control group did not receive any intervention. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and ANSWatch TS0411 (Taiwan Scientific, Xīndiàn, New Taipei, Taiwan). HRV was measured using the ANSWatch. Background variables included sociodemographics (age, sex, educational level, marital status, and children at home), work status (work unit, work years, and shift-work status in the last month and the current month), and use of hypnotics. Background variables were measured at baseline. Psychological symptoms were measured at baseline and every week after the three sessions were completed. Insomnia was measured at baseline and every 2 weeks thereafter. Psychological symptoms were measured using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) [ Sleep problems were measured using the ISI [ Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 28.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). Characteristics by intervention or control group were examined using the  The baseline characteristics of the intervention and control groups are presented in  Tables  In  As significant differences in age and probable differences in preintervention psychological state were found between the intervention and control groups, GEE was used to yield age- and preintervention psychological state-adjusted effects ( The results of HRV indicators, including arrhythmia, HRV, and LF/HF, did not differ significantly between the intervention and control groups after the 4-week LLLT. Approximately 30% of study nurses had arrhythmia pretests (31% for both groups). After completion of the 4-week LLLT, the proportion of study nurses with arrhythmia was 28% in the intervention group and 37% in the control group ( Approximately 66% of study nurses had dysautonomia pretest (control group: 63%, intervention group: 69%). After completion of the 4-week LLLT, the proportion of study nurses with dysautonomia was 72% in the intervention group and 75% in the control group ( This study found that LLLT intervention three times a week for 4 weeks was effective in treating insomnia, depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms among shift-work nurses with self-reported insomnia. The study nurses were on a 1-month fixed shift (the same shift schedule in a month); as a result, the intervention time was set at 4 weeks to decrease the effect of the transition between day, evening, and night work. The light waves, source, irradiation times, and duration differ across previous studies, limiting the comparability with the current study. Despite this, the present study agreed with previous studies in showing the effectiveness of LLLT in improving sleep problems and psychological symptoms [ The full mechanisms of LLLT remain under investigation. Nevertheless, transcranial PBM using red or near-infrared light can penetrate the skull, enhance cytochrome c oxidase activity, and boost mitochondrial metabolism [ The LLLT intervention was not effective in altering HRV indicators, though the prevalence of arrhythmia was 31% preintervention and 28% postintervention. The prevalence of dysautonomia was 69% preintervention and 72% postintervention. Prior research suggests that shift work is related to circadian rhythm irregularity that can lead to cardiac dysautonomia [ Past studies have shown that nurses' shift work and circadian rhythm disorders affect heart rhythm variability and cause abnormal indicators [ Due to their work characteristics, job stress, and shift-work schedules, nurses have a high risk of psychological stress and chronic diseases [ Though we used random assignment, the intervention group was significantly younger than the control group. Besides, the intervention group showed lower pretest scores in depression, anxiety, and stress, though not statistically significant. Therefore, we applied GEE to adjust for age and preintervention states. The study nurses were from a single medical center, and the sample size was small. Future studies with a heterogeneous population and larger sample sizes are needed. The shift work in this study was based on a fixed and regular 8-h shift. Further studies are also needed to examine and compare LLLT's effectiveness across different shift-work schedules and patterns. LLLT three times a week for 4 weeks improved sleep quality in shift-work nurses with insomnia and alleviated depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms; however, it did not improve HRV. This is a single-center study with a relatively small sample size, while the results are promising, studies with larger sample sizes and at different hospital settings are needed to further evaluate the effects before recommending widespread implementation.",

      "title": "Psoriasis: an update on topical and systemic therapies",
      "content": "Psoriasis is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease with a genetic predisposition. Although manifesting predominantly as a hyperproliferative skin disorder, psoriasis is a systemic disease associated with a range of comorbidities including arthritis, cardiovascular disease and depression. Educating the patient that psoriasis is chronic and that there are possible comorbidities is paramount. Patients with a limited number of plaques and no systemic symptoms may be managed with intermittent use of topical therapies. Those with more extensive or debilitating disease may require phototherapy or systemic medicines such as methotrexate or one of the newer targeted therapies. Newer systemic therapies, including oral medicines and injectable biologics, can only be used following unsuccessful treatment with traditional therapies such as methotrexate and phototherapy. Biologic therapies for psoriasis offer the possibility of near-complete symptom resolution in people with psoriatic disease. Psoriasis is a multisystem immune-mediated inflammatory disease. It manifests predominantly as a hyperproliferative papulosquamous skin disorder, but is associated with a range of comorbidities, such as psoriatic arthritis and cardiovascular disease. The physician-diagnosed prevalence of psoriasis in adults in Australia is estimated at around 2.4%. Psoriasis can have a large impact on quality of life, with 75% of patients reporting alterations in daily activities, difficulties with body image and self-esteem, and feelings of stigma, shame and embarrassment. Psoriasis has a multi-factorial inheritance, The onset of psoriasis has 2 peaks: at age 15 to 20 years (more common in females), and over the age of 40 (equal sex distribution). Diagnosis of psoriasis is almost always clinical. Biopsy is not recommended in most cases. Typical psoriatic lesions have been classically described as well-circumscribed, salmon-pink plaques with a loosely adherent scale. The plaques are usually symmetrical and often occur on areas of skin trauma such as elbows and knees (Koebner phenomenon). They are generally not itchy, but pruritus (itch) can be prominent particularly in older patients. Children may present with thick plaques with dense scale in the scalp (pityriasis amiantacea). Teenage patients often present with widespread, truncal, pink plaques which may be itchy (guttate psoriasis) following streptococcal pharyngitis. Older adults may present with widespread erythema and sometimes minimal scale (erythrodermic psoriasis). The multiple presentations of psoriasis can make the diagnosis difficult and often other clues are sought including nail changes, such as pitting and separation of the nail from its nail bed (onycholysis), thick skin in weight-bearing areas, stubborn dandruff and family history of psoriasis. The differential diagnoses for similar well-circumscribed scaly plaques include skin cancer (Bowen disease), eczematous patches, dermatophyte infection, cutaneous lupus erythematosus and mycosis fungoides. The wide differential and variable morphology of psoriasis mean that it is often misdiagnosed. There are Australian consensus criteria for the assessment of psoriasis severity and determining suitability for systemic therapy ( Moderate to severe psoriasis is disease that cannot be adequately managed with topical therapy alone and requires phototherapy or systemic therapy. Patients may be candidates for systemic therapy if they meet at least one of the following criteria: body surface area affected is more than 10% Psoriasis Area of Severity Index (PASI) is more than 10 Physician Global Assessment (PGA) is more than 2 (scale of 0 to 4) Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is more than 10 psoriatic disease involves high-impact areas (face, nails, genitalia, scalp, palmoplantar [hands or feet] and intertriginous skin) [NB1] severe pruritus leading to excoriation failure of topical therapy. NB1: Validated tools for assessing disease severity at specific high-impact sites are available; these may be useful when disease is localised. Psoriasis is a systemic disease and is associated with a range of significant comorbidities. Moderate and severe psoriasis have also been associated with excess mortality. Specific comorbidities are part of the psoriatic disease; these include arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and uveitis. Up to 40% of patients with psoriasis may have some form of joint involvement. Severe psoriasis is associated with nonspecific comorbidities such as metabolic syndrome and obesity. Psoriasis is an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction and stroke. Patients with psoriasis have higher rates of mental illness, substance abuse and self-harm, and higher likelihood of suicidal ideation, attempts and completion. Because psoriasis is a systemic disease that may affect, for example, joints, bowel and eyes, systemic therapy may be required. Management of the skin disease using topical agents reduces the symptoms (itch, scale) and the impact of skin symptoms on quality of life, but does not treat the systemic disease. Also, topical therapies can be hard to use, messy and have relatively poor compliance. Patients with a limited number of plaques and no systemic symptoms may be managed with intermittent use of topical therapies. Patients with moderate to severe psoriasis with features such as skin disease affecting more than 10% of body surface, pustular psoriasis, erythroderma, recalcitrant plaques or disease with significant impact on quality of life (e.g. interfering with function) ( Systemic corticosteroids (e.g. oral prednisolone) must be avoided as a rapid reduction of dose can precipitate catastrophic pustular psoriasis, a potentially life-threatening medical emergency. Educating the patient that psoriasis is chronic and that there are possible comorbidities is paramount. Patients can be reassured that the rash is not contagious, and that steps can be taken to reduce flares such as reducing alcohol intake, stopping smoking and optimising diet. Initial management of mild to moderate psoriasis typically involves the use of topical treatments, such as emollients, corticosteroids, calcipotriol, tar and dithranol. There is little evidence to guide the selection of topical treatments, so it can be based on patient and prescriber preference. Regular (at least once daily) use of a fragrance-free moisturiser, particularly on thick plaques of elbows, knees and the sacral area, can reduce the scale and discomfort associated with cracking skin. Emollients can be supplemented with keratolytics such as urea (10%) or salicylic acid (up to 6%) with a thick cream base or white soft paraffin. Stronger keratolytics (e.g. urea 25%, salicylic acid greater than 8%) are useful on the thick skin of palms and soles but can be painful on raw or open skin. Topical corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory action and reduce the scale and hyperproliferation of the skin. Although topical corticosteroids are effective at reducing the erythema and scale, prolonged use will cause tachyphylaxis (less efficacy) over time, extension of the area of disease and flare after stopping. Hence, they should be used only for a short time (e.g. 2 to 3 weeks) and/or intermittently (e.g. weekends). Low-potency corticosteroids (e.g. methylprednisolone aceponate or hydrocortisone 1%) can be used on the face and genital areas. More potent topical corticosteroids (e.g. mometasone furoate, betamethasone dipropionate) are needed for thick plaques on the scalp, elbows and knees, and palms and soles. Topical calcipotriol, a vitamin D analogue, is antiproliferative and reduces the size of psoriatic plaques. It can be irritant and should be avoided on the face, flexural areas and groin. Excessive use (more than 100 g per week) can increase the risk of hypercalcaemia. Calcipotriol is only available on the PBS as a combination product with a potent topical corticosteroid; due to the steroid component, this should only be used short term or intermittently. Tar and dithranol are traditional topical therapies that can be cost-effective but have fallen out of favour because they are messy and odorous. Liquid coal tar ( Dithranol (1%) ointment can be applied to thick plaques and washed off after 10 to 30 minutes (short-contact dithranol therapy). It can stain skin and light-coloured hair. Management options for moderate to severe psoriasis include: phototherapy (narrowband UVB) older oral medicines (methotrexate, acitretin and cyclosporin) newer oral medicines (apremilast, deucravacitinib) injectable biologic medicines (tumour necrosis factor [TNF] alpha inhibitors, and anti-interleukin [IL]-17, anti-IL-23, and anti-IL-12 and 23 therapies). There is little evidence to inform the order of treatment selection; however, the newer oral medicines and injectable biologic medicines require prior unsuccessful treatment with older therapies such as methotrexate and/or phototherapy, and consultation with a dermatologist, rheumatologist or general physician to obtain PBS subsidy ( \n methotrexate \n acitretin \n apremilast cyclosporin deucravacitinib \n TNF alpha inhibitors etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab and their biosimilars anti-IL-17 therapies secukinumab, ixekizumab, bimekizumab anti-IL-23 therapies guselkumab, risankizumab, tildrakizumab anti-IL-12 and 23 therapies ustekinumab GP = general practitioner; IL = interleukin; TNF = tumour necrosis factor NB1: Based on Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) criteria at the time of writing. NB2: There are no PBS restrictions on who can prescribe acitretin, but state and territory regulations, and medical indemnity considerations, may limit who can initiate this drug. NB3: Categories of specialist physician that can initiate biologic drugs varies by drug and indication. Refer to the PBS Schedule for details. It may be reasonable to start treatment with oral methotrexate in primary care if there will be a long delay (e.g. more than 3 months) in accessing a dermatologist or other specialist who can prescribe newer therapies. Narrowband UVB (wavelength 311 to 312 nm) is effective at clearing most thin plaques of psoriasis in 80% of patients. The patient stands in a treatment box with shielded eyes or face for up to 15 minutes at a time. Treatment requires 3 days per week therapy over several weeks. Downsides of phototherapy are the time commitment, potential increased risk of skin cancer and premature ageing. Oral methotrexate, generally 10 to 20 mg once weekly with a folic acid supplement, has been shown to improve psoriasis in about 60% of patients. With regular monitoring of blood count, liver function and kidney function, it is relatively safe and effective. Methotrexate is a folate antagonist and is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy. It is passed on in breast milk, and it affects spermatogenesis. Methotrexate has many potential side effects, including gastrointestinal upset, mouth ulceration, and bone marrow suppression. It can be hepatotoxic, particularly in psoriatic patients with metabolic syndrome and associated steatotic liver disease. Permanent liver cirrhosis can occur with prolonged use and high cumulative doses. Clinicians need to be aware that this is not a set-and-forget treatment; it requires ongoing monitoring. Acitretin is an orally administered retinoid that has some efficacy in palmoplantar psoriasis and erythrodermic psoriasis. At psoriatic effective doses, there are significant side effects including dryness of lips, eyes and skin with peeling palms and soles. There is often diffuse hair loss, especially in older women. It can cause impaired liver function; concomitant alcohol use is discouraged. It usually increases serum lipids. It is teratogenic and should not be used in women of childbearing age. Patients cannot donate blood for up to 3 years after stopping treatment as the drug and teratogenic metabolites can remain long term. State or territory health department authorisation may be required before prescribing acitretin. Acitretin can be used in conjunction with phototherapy where it can enhance therapy especially in thick plaques. Cyclosporin is a calcineurin inhibitor that is immunosuppressive. It has a limited role because it invariably causes renal impairment and hypertension with prolonged use, and psoriasis flares rapidly on stopping. Cyclosporin is, however, very effective in rapidly clearing disease and can be used as a rescue treatment in patients with pustular or widespread disease while starting other agents with slower onset of action but better long-term safety. Monitoring of blood pressure and renal function is essential. It can be effective in treating acute psoriatic arthritis. Apremilast is an oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor with efficacy in both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. The advent of injectable biologic therapies for psoriasis has resulted in the possibility of nearly disease-free activity, with very high efficacy in treatment of psoriatic disease. In clinical trials there were also reductions in depression and anxiety scores, Biologic therapies are very costly and use in Australia is restricted to patients with PASI over 15, or more than 30% disease on face, palms and soles, as well as failure of 2 systemic therapies of at least 6 weeks duration each. TNF alpha inhibitors (etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab and their biosimilars) are rarely used today as first-line therapies due to the availability of more effective drugs with higher psoriasis clearance rates and longer persistence of effect. However, they are often utilised in inpatient treatment for severe pustular psoriasis due to their rapidity of action. TNF alpha inhibitors are contraindicated in patients with active infections including tuberculosis, and have a higher rate of infection than the other biologic agents. They may worsen congestive cardiac failure. Although effective in clearing skin disease (up to 45% in infliximab), most patients show loss of efficacy over 2 to 3 years. Anti-IL-17 therapies (bimekizumab, ixekizumab, secukinumab), anti-IL-23 therapies (guselkumab, risankizumab, tildrakizumab) and anti-IL-12 and 23 therapies (ustekinumab) show strong efficacy (up to 88% patients with near-complete skin clearance) and long persistence. Anti-IL-17 therapies have slightly higher rates of infection, particularly oral thrush, but have demonstrated better efficacy on joints, compared with anti-IL-23 therapies. Anti-IL-17 therapies are contraindicated in inflammatory bowel disease as they may catastrophically flare active disease. Anti-IL-23 and anti-IL-12 and 23 therapies have few side effects (injection-site reaction is most common). They have some efficacy especially in peripheral psoriatic arthritis, and in higher doses are effective in inflammatory bowel disease. Psoriasis is a common multisystem inflammatory disease that has profound impact on patients. Although skin disease is the most common presentation, effective management of psoriasis requires identification and management of associated comorbidities. Topical therapies are useful in reducing the skin symptoms. Systemic treatments, including new biologic medicines, treat both skin and systemic disease.",

      "title": "The Epidemiology and Determinants of Opportunistic Intestinal Parasites Among HIV-Positive Patients Attending Care and Treatment Centers in Northcentral Ethiopia",
      "content": "Opportunistic intestinal parasites (OIPs), such as coccidian parasites (like  Past research on OIP infections has shown that a range of factors play a role in spreading the infection in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. These include determinants like not keeping sanitary facilities clean, using unsafe water sources, not having enough toilets, not teaching people about how the infection spreads, not following good hygiene habits, not having enough income, and living in overcrowded conditions [ Different researchers reported the prevalence of coccidian parasites in Ethiopia among people with HIV [ In several rural villages within the Debre Tabor district, clean water is scarce, forcing community members to rely on unsafe water sources. This reliance on diverse water sources significantly increases the likelihood of illness from waterborne diseases. Additionally, the levels of environmental sanitation and personal hygiene in these rural villages are notably poor (South Gondar Health Office, personal communication, November 2019). Additionally, there is no information about the coinfection rate of OIPs among patients attending ART. Up-to-date information regarding OIP magnitude and predictors is vital for better treatment and interventions and may support national and international HIV END strategies and eradication programs. Therefore, the study is aimed at estimating the prevalence of OIPs and determining drivers among HIV-positive patients on ART treatment in Debre Tabor General Hospital, Northcentral Ethiopia. A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted between December 2019 and February 2020 at Debre Tabor General Hospital in Debre Tabor town, located in Northcentral Ethiopia. Debre Tabor is a town situated 667 km away from Addis Ababa, elevated at 2706 m above sea level. Serving around 2.3 million individuals, the hospital boasts over 110 beds. The hospital has been providing HIV counseling, testing, treatment, and follow-up services since the 1990s. At the hospital's ART clinic, 2210 HIV/AIDS patients were actively receiving ART during the study period. The medical records, however, pointed to a greater figure. At Debre Tabor General Hospital, all HIV-positive individuals who registered at the ART clinic were included as a source of the population. All registered HIV/AIDS patients actively attending appointments or follow-up at the ART clinic of the hospital during the study duration were chosen for the research. This study encompassed all individuals with HIV/AIDS who provided written consent to participate and visited ART clinics during the examination period. Only those who expressed a desire to take part in the study were included. Those participants who have been taking antiparasitic medication during the last 3 months were excluded from this study. Also, those severely ill patients who were unable to respond to questions or with a history or diagnosis of acute or chronic disease–causing immune suppression (COVID-19, tuberculosis, asthma, cirrhosis, cancer, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, transplant recipients, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) were excluded from the study. We used a formula to determine the size of the sample ( After adding 10% (38) for contingency, the final sample size was 422 individuals. A systematic random sampling method was employed by calculating the  The study was focused on the following independent variables: sociodemographic status, environmental and personal hygiene, the status of ART adherence, clinical conditions, and the immune status of the patient. The prevalence of OIPs was considered the response variable in the present study. A structured questionnaire was prepared, pretested, and validated before 2 weeks of study at Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital in Bahir Dar on 20 people with HIV to evaluate the quality and strength of the questionnaire. The ART clinician and principal investigators provided a directional view and awareness of the study's objective to encourage active participation in filling out the questionnaire. The questionnaire was originally prepared in English and then translated to Amharic and back to English to obtain content validity. After modifying and assuring its quality, the pretested questionnaires were administered to respondents to generate data on risk factors of OIPs, such as questions related to sociodemographic characteristics, behavioral habits, hygienic and sanitary conditions, environmental conditions, and clinical information. The recent CD4+ T cell count data was taken from patients' medical records. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, a specialized form of flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, California, United States), was used to determine the count at the Debre Tabor General Hospital ART clinic. The proper method for the collection of stool samples was provided to ensure the favorable condition of the stool sample. Also, an oral description and specific instructions on proper handling and avoiding contamination of the stool specimen were given to the entire participant by the investigator. Disposable plastic cups with an applicator spoon for the collection of stool samples were provided for study subjects by labeling them with their unique codes, and after that, they were told to bring about 5–10 g of fresh stool specimen each. Initially, a wet mount was prepared, followed by the preservation of the remaining sample in a 10% formalin solution. The collected stool samples were promptly preserved in 10% formalin until microscopy, which helps maintain the shape and size of protozoan and helminth parasites and prevents further development [ A direct wet-mount smear was examined immediately by using normal saline. Observe under a light microscope at 100x and 400x magnifications to detect the presence of motile parasite stages. After preserving the remaining sample in 10% formalin, it was carefully examined using the formol–ether concentration technique along with a modified Ziehl–Neelsen staining method [ Briefly, 1 g of stool was taken from the preserved stool, mixed with a 10% formalin solution, and sieved through double-layered gauze. The filtrate was transferred to a 15-mL conical centrifuge tube and added to 7 mL of formalin saline using a plastic pipette and 3 mL of diethyl ether. Then, the content was shaken vigorously and centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm. After collecting the sediment, a slide was prepared and examined under a light microscope at both 100x and 400x magnification to identify eggs, cysts, and larvae of various parasites. A small portion of the fresh stool sample was processed for the detection of  Before actual data collection began, experienced laboratory technologists pretested the questionnaire and other materials, such as the microscope, centrifuge, and chemicals used during data collection. The specimens were also checked for serial number, quality, and collection procedures. The stool samples were examined by two laboratory technicians in order to avoid observer bias. If conflicting results were found, a different technician examined the stool sample slide, and their findings were deemed conclusive. In addition to the color atlas, the laboratory technicians used known positive coccidian parasite samples as positive controls and performed staining. Furthermore, the researchers validated their staining procedure against the literature using known positive samples to ensure it was functioning as expected. Regarding CD4+ T cells, data collectors were trained, and after the data collection process, the collected data were double-checked for completeness by three investigators, and any incomplete or misfiled data were filed again. Next, the findings from the lab were detailed meticulously on a neatly organized document before being affixed to the survey. Descriptive statistics were used to understand the property and the pattern of data collected from respondents. The data obtained from questionnaires was entered through the EPI-INFO 7 computer program for precoding data and then exported to SPSS Version 23. A chi-square test was applied to determine the association between parasitic infection and CD4+ T cell count. The logistic regression model was employed to assess potential risk factors. The strength of associations was measured using odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Multivariate regression analysis was then applied for variables with  In general, our research adhered to the guidelines set out in the Declaration of Helsinki [ A total of 384 HIV-positive individuals were included. Of these, 222 (57.8%) were females, and 215 (56.0) of the respondents were aged 30–49, with the mean (SD) age of 34.30 (± 11.073) years. The majority of the participants were urban residents, 262 (68.2%); married, 241 (62.8%); civil servants, 127 (33.1%); and above secondary educational status, 124 (32.3%) ( The majority of the participants used tap water for drinking 256 (66.7%) and had an occasional hand washing habit before a meal 349 (90.9%), CD4+ T-cell counts above 500 cells/ Totally, 384 samples of stool were reviewed to detect infections caused by parasites within the intestines. Among these, 122 (31.7%) were found positive for an intestinal parasite (both opportunistic and nonopportunistic parasite species). The overall prevalence of opportunistic parasite infections was found to be 69/384 (17.96%). From 122 positive cases, 110 (28.7%) were infected with single parasites ( In this study, eight species of intestinal parasites were detected. Of these parasites, five belonged to protozoans, and the remaining three belonged to helminthic parasites. The most frequent parasite species detected from the opportunistic intestinal protozoan parasites was  There were (3.1%) cases of double infections with opportunistic intestinal protozoan–protozoan and protozoan–helminths observed. Among the double infections, all (12) cases displayed coccidian parasites ( In multivariate logistic regression analysis, patients who lived in rural areas were less likely to acquire OIPs than patients who had lived in urban areas (AOR = 0.197%, 95% CI: 0.053–0.734,  Patients whose CD4 The proportion of OIPs was significantly higher in patients with a CD4 On the other hand, 98 study participants had a CD4 Individuals with a weakened immune system are more susceptible to intestinal parasites. People with HIV/AIDS often have intestinal parasite infections. HIV weakens the immune system, making it easier for intestinal parasites to cause malnutrition, weight loss, and ongoing diarrhea, making the patient's health worse [ In the current study, the prevalence of OIPs among HIV/AIDS patients who attend ART was 17.96%. It is consistent with studies conducted in Arba Minch (17.2%) [ \n The second OIP identified was  \n Study participants having a < 200 cells/ Individuals who did not have the habit of handwashing after the toilet were 10.4 times more likely to be infected with OIPs than their counterparts. Eshetu and colleagues [ The risk of acquiring OIP infection was 7.03 (95% CI: 1.882–26.512,  In this finding, poor adherence to ART drugs was 7.42 times more likely to be infected by OIPs when compared to good adherence (AOR = 7.427, 95% CI: 2.488–22.172,  In this finding, patients residing in rural areas were less likely to be at risk for OIP when compared with urban residents. The findings of the current study support the previous research conducted in Burkina Faso [ In the current study, HIV/AIDS patients who had drinking water from unprotected sources were 14.721 times more likely to harbor OIPs than those using tap water.

      "content": "Cancer screening lowers morbidity and mortality from cancer, and is cost-effective. The COVID-19 pandemic upended cancer screening utilization in 2020 with data showing a deficit in screened patients in 2020 and 2021 as compared to 2019, with return to 2019 baseline screening levels by December 2022. The cumulative shortfall in screenings, lasting nearly three years into the pandemic, are predicted by models to generate an incremental population cancer burden in the out years of the models. Recovery of screening rates may vary based on the racial or ethnic population, and time will tell if there is an uneven burden of future cancers that worsen cancer incidence and mortality in those populations, some even after years of gains of reducing disparities for cancer screening. For some cancer screenings, particularly cervical and colorectal cancer, use of at-home non-invasive tests may increase screening participation overall across multiple populations, and may help mitigate some of the screening shortfalls from 2020 to 2022 by elevating numbers of the population screened. For colorectal cancer, new additional comparably sensitive or ease-of-use non-invasive screening tests are being added for utilization.",

      "title": "Genetic ancestry superpopulations show distinct prevalence and outcomes across pediatric central nervous system tumors from the Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas and Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium",
      "content": "Central nervous system (CNS) tumors lead to cancer-related mortality in children. Genetic ancestry-associated cancer prevalence and outcomes have been studied but are limited. We performed genetic ancestry prediction in 1,452 pediatric patients with paired normal and tumor whole genome sequencing from the Open Pediatric Cancer (OpenPedCan) project to evaluate the influence of reported race and ethnicity and ancestry-based genetic superpopulations on tumor histology, molecular subtype, survival, and treatment. Predicted superpopulations included African (AFR,  Genetic ancestry-associated differences exist across pediatric CNS tumor histological and molecular subtypes from PBTA and PNOC. Further investigation into genetic and socioeconomic factors contributing to these observed inequities is needed. Distinct associations of genetic ancestry-based superpopulations exist within pediatric CNS tumor histologic and molecular subtypes and correlate with survival outcomes and treatment. This work provides critical insight into the impact of reported race and ethnicity and genetic-based ancestry superpopulations on nearly 1500 pediatric patients with CNS tumors who had matched normal and tumor sequencing performed. We identify novel associations between ancestry superpopulations and tumor histology, molecular subtypes, and treatments received. Here, we begin to inform on the contributions of social constructs of race and ethnicity and tumor characteristics that are enriched among genetic-based ancestry superpopulations on clinical outcomes of pediatric patients with CNS tumors. Our findings indicate that potential social and genetic risk stratifications exist for pediatric CNS tumors and warrant further investigation to ensure equitable clinical outcomes for all patients. Primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in children. It is essential to recognize that race and ethnicity are social and cultural constructs distinct from genetic ancestry, which can be estimated using genetic markers that capture ancestral population migration patterns and admixture events. In the current study, we aim to go beyond previous work investigating genomic correlates of cancer risk in isolated silos and utilize a large cohort of patients with broad histologies of primary pediatric CNS tumors to explore the potential contributions of genomics and social health risk categories. We specifically utilize predicted genetic ancestries to evaluate associations with incidence and clinical outcomes across a diverse group of pediatric CNS tumor diagnoses. This work provides an essential framework to better characterize the contributions of genetic and sociodemographic factors to cancer outcomes in patients with pediatric CNS tumors, and ideally augment our understanding of pediatric CNS tumor risk stratification through a lens of health equity. The pediatric CNS tumor patient cohort used in this study was derived from the Open Pediatric Cancer (OpenPedCan) project, We used the somalier suite of tools (v.0.2.15) to predict ancestry superpopulations from non-tumor WGS data. All high-confidence, in-frame  The association between reported race and ethnicity and genetic ancestry superpopulation, as well as superpopulation enrichment within race and ethnicity groups, was assessed using Fisher’s exact tests. We integrated CNS tumor histology and molecular subtype data from matched tumor samples with survival data to determine whether genetic ancestry superpopulations were associated with cancer type, subtype, and/or survival. Nonrandom distribution and enrichment of superpopulations within histologies and molecular subtypes were assessed using Fisher’s exact tests and one-way Fisher’s exact tests, respectively. Statistical significance was defined as Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted FDR < 0.05, and marginally significant trends were defined as  We performed Kaplan–Meier analysis of OS and EFS within histologies and molecular subtypes to compare outcomes of patients of different genetic ancestry groups. We generated Cox proportional-hazards regression models to identify additional variables that were predictive of survival using the following covariates: predicted genetic ancestry superpopulation, age at diagnosis (all models), molecular subtype (ATRT, LGG, HGG, ependymoma [EPN], medulloblastoma [MB], mixed glioneuronal tumors), and extent of tumor resection (ATRT, LGG, EPN, HGG, MB, and schwannoma, to accommodate the known impact of degree of resection on outcome in these cohorts). We generated separate models replacing ancestry superpopulation with (1) EUR membership (EUR or non-EUR) and (2) somalier PC values to assess whether other measures of genetic ancestry were associated with distinct survival outcomes. Chi-square analyses were run on each multivariate model to assess the overall effect of superpopulation on survival in each independent tumor histology or molecular subtype cohort. To assess the association between  We predicted genetic ancestry for 1452 pediatric CNS tumor patients from the PBTA and PNOC. Patients were classified into genetic ancestry superpopulations as follows:  Genetic ancestry prediction in a pediatric central nervous system tumor cohort.  There was a significant nonrandom association between reported race and ethnicity and superpopulation ( We identified a significant nonrandom association between genetic ancestry superpopulation and CNS tumor histology ( Distribution of CNS tumor histologies and molecular subtypes across genetic ancestry superpopulations. ( We observed significant enrichment of genetic ancestry superpopulations in molecular subtypes of specific CNS tumor histologies. We found that patients with non- A recent report from the PNOC001 trial identified two classes of in-frame  \n We also observed breakpoint type-specific distribution of LGG tumors in CNS regions that correlated with the extent of tumor resection ( We identified eleven patients with seven distinct rare  We calculated median EFS and OS for each CNS tumor histology and molecular subtype with sufficient sample size ( Next, we assessed pairwise differences in patient survival by superpopulation within the cohorts selected above. Among patients with GCTs, those from non-EUR superpopulations exhibited significantly worse EFS relative to those from the EUR superpopulation (median EFS 0.5 vs. 2.1 years, HR = 12.1, 95% CI = 1.9–79.6,  Genetic ancestry-associated overall and event-free survival (EFS) differences in pediatric CNS tumor patients.

Among the five derived PC values, we observed significant correlations with estimated probabilities of distinct superpopulations ( To explore therapeutic approaches employed across genetic ancestry superpopulations, we investigated degree of surgical intervention, clinical trial enrollment, and therapeutic regimens cohort-wide and within tumor histologies. We assessed degree of surgical resection by superpopulation for all major histologies with  Overall frequency of upfront clinical trial enrollment was significantly associated with genetic ancestry ( Overall frequency of clinical trial enrollment and photon vs. proton radiation at time of upfront diagnosis.

Abbreviations: AFR, African; AMR, American; EAS, Eat Asian; EUR, European; SAS, South Asian. Pediatric CNS tumor treatment frequency by genetic ancestry superpopulation. ( We further assessed whether frequency of proton versus photon radiation therapy differed across superpopulations. There was a trend toward genetic ancestry-dependent frequency of upfront proton radiation treatment across all tumor histologies ( We incorporated clinical trial and radiation therapy data into survival models to determine if treatment was associated with survival outcomes in tumor histologies for which genetic ancestry was a significant predictor of survival. There was no significant effect of treatment on survival for patients with LGG, EPN, or GCTs, indicating that statistically significant ancestry-related differences in survival were not statistically associated with clinical trial enrollment in our cohort ( In this study, we sought to investigate the influence of genetic ancestry on the prevalence of CNS tumor subtypes, treatment access, and survival outcomes in pediatric patients. Our findings revealed significant associations between genetic ancestry superpopulations, prevalence of CNS tumor histologies and molecular subtypes, patient OS and EFS, and upfront treatment approaches. Notably, we also identified superpopulation-specific enrichment of  Race and ethnicity are social constructs based on membership in a group sharing cultural and behavioral traits, whereas genetic ancestry is based on variations in genomic structure between groups from similar geographic regions. We found significant associations between ancestry superpopulations and cancer groups. Patients with ATRT or meningioma tumors were significantly enriched among AFR patients. While previous work has shown an increased incidence of meningiomas among patients of reported Black race, We next report associations between predicted ancestry superpopulation and tumor molecular subtypes. EUR superpopulation patients with LGG diagnoses had tumors enriched with non- In our analysis of LGG breakpoint type frequency, we found that 93.6% of patients harbored one of the four common  In this cohort, we found that patients of predicted non-European ancestry exhibited significantly worse OS and EFS compared to patients of predicted European ancestry in certain tumor histologies and molecular subtypes. Patients of non-EUR ancestry with GCT and of AMR ancestry with SHH medulloblastomas had worse EFS compared to EUR patients with the same diagnoses. AFR superpopulation patients with LGG or EPN showed significantly worse OS compared to EUR patients, consistent with prior findings of lower survival among Black children with these tumors. Our study also found varying upfront clinical trial enrollment frequencies by genetic ancestry superpopulation. This is encouraging, as it highlights the importance of including patients from diverse genetic backgrounds in clinical research and may represent contemporary changes that better facilitate equitable enrollment in trials and research activities. Although our work included patients from a diverse set of genetic and predicted ancestral backgrounds, our data came from patients within the United States. Thus, our cohort was significantly enriched for the European superpopulation, with limited numbers of historically marginalized racial and ethnic groups in our study (ie, AI/AN and NHPI). Expanding access to international pediatric datasets with potentially unique SDoH considerations will be critical for including diverse representation in future research. While the inclusion of molecular subtypes in our analyses allowed for a more nuanced exploration of tumor risk across superpopulations, our sample sizes for several subtypes were limited. We report our findings with full consideration of these small sample sizes, which we hope to mitigate with ongoing enrollment and larger sample sizes in planned follow-up reports. Further, the discovery of novel molecular features and further subdivision of current molecular subtypes may lead to reduced power to detect ancestry-associated prevalence and outcomes. For example, the  Importantly, our work did not consider the contributions of SDoH to survival, such as socioeconomic status, insurance status, and time to diagnosis, which are well-known to impact survival. Our work revealed several new findings in pediatric CNS tumor histologies and molecular subtypes across genetic superpopulations, highlighting associations with survival and upfront treatment approaches. To further improve equity in care and outcomes for children with CNS malignancies, additional research is needed to delineate the extent to which race and ethnicity differences are driven by societal determinants or tumor biology and molecular subtypes related to genetic ancestry.

      "title": "Research on mammary gland hyperplasia compound patents’ herbal combination rules based on complex system entropy clustering: A review",
      "content": "The aim of this study was to investigate the combination rules of herbal compound patents for the treatment of mammary gland hyperplasia (MGH). Herbal compound patents (oral drugs) for the treatment of MGH from the past 31 years were collected, and a database was created. Complex system entropy clustering was used to analyze the prescription rule of herbal compound patents for the treatment of MGH. In total, 765 MGH herbal compound authorized patents, including 136 Chinese herbs, were identified. High-frequency herbs, herbal pairs, and core associations were obtained by complex system entropy clustering. MGH herbal compound patents are known to activate blood circulation, remove stasis, soothe the liver, regulate  Mammary gland hyperplasia (MGH) is a common gynecological disease among young and middle-aged women whose incidence is increasing year by year, which seriously affects the patient’s quality of life. Androgens, progesterone (P), tamoxifen, bromocriptine, danazol and other hormonal drugs are commonly used to treat this disease. However, although these drugs can improve the symptoms of MGH, their side effects are severe. Notably, the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) compound prescription for treating MGH shows its effectiveness in the treatment of this disease. In long-term clinical practice, TCM has accumulated numerous herbal compounds with outstanding curative effects. The herbal combination pattern determined by complex system-based entropy clustering could enhance the accuracy of clinical prescriptions, making the selection of herbal core combinations easier and more accurate. There are many academic cores in the MGH herbal compound patents, which will have remarkable curative effect on clinical treatment. In this study, the patents for oral herb prescriptions for MGH treatment from the past 30 years were selected for analysis. Herbal frequency, association, and composition compatibility regularity were investigated to guide the clinical prescription and development of new drugs. This study introduces the boundary mutual distance into the mutual information registration measure. By combining mutual information and mutual distance information, the resulting new registration measure improves the mutual information registration measuring function, thus reducing the risk of the conventional maximum mutual information function falling into the extremum and defining the accurate ratio of information about the MGH patent compound composition (Figs.  Algorithm of the research process. Research process of entropy clustering of complex systems for traditional Chinese medicine compound patents. Key steps in entropy clustering research of complex systems. This study aims to investigate the active ingredients, targets, pathways, and mechanisms of drug pairs or drug combinations in the treatment of MGH. The literature search covered the Derwent World Patent Index database, the National Intellectual Property Office patent database, the World Digital Library of Intellectual Property, the Multinational Patent Review Information Search System, TCM enterprises, and related herbal intellectual property organizations. MGH herbal compound authorized patents between January 1993 and December 2023 were retrieved.

Based on the recall-precision curve, the retrieval formulas were optimized and adjusted dynamically. 1.  Single herb 2.  Integrated use of multiple approaches 3.  Simultaneously treating other diseases 4.  Combined medication All the collected literature on patents for herbal compounds for breast hyperplasia were checked by 3 persons to ensure accuracy and precision. The EpiData 3.1 system (EpiData Association, Odense, Denmark) was used to develop the data mining software. Each eligible MGH prescription patent herb was assigned a 2-valued variable. Data mining was performed using mathematical entropy modeling and screening out herbal pairs and core combinations with strong efficacy coherence. Complex system entropy clustering and improved mutual information methods were used to construct the research program and create the research model in order to initiate the quantitative description of the correlation coefficient of Chinese medicine. The ultimate purpose was to extract the herbal pairs and herbal core combinations. Mathematical modeling was used to mine the MGH prescription patents. The most relevant core combinations of Chinese herbs were screened out by mathematical calculations, comprising core herbal pairs and herbal teams. The improved mutual information methods, complex system entropy clustering methods, and unsupervised entropy hierarchical clustering methods were used for data analysis. The core formulas of the improved mutual information methods and complex system entropy clustering methods are the following: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering can be described using the following formula:  where  The above process can also be expressed as follows: where  In this study, a total of 765 prescriptions in the database were analyzed and screened using the methods mentioned above. A total of 136 Chinese herbs with high frequency and 62 regularly used drug pairs were obtained using an improved mutual information method, and 32 groups of core combinations were obtained using complex system-based entropy clustering. The high frequency efficacy, high frequency herbs, herbal pairs, efficacy pairing of Chinese herbs and herbal core combinations are shown in Tables  The effects of high frequency herbs are associated with promoting blood circulation, removing blood stasis, detumescing, pain relieving, clearing heat and detoxifying, liver soothing and regulating  High frequency efficacy.

Verification of the statistical significance of the results: Significance testing of occurrence of high frequency herbs: The chi-square test was used to verify the frequency of occurrence of high frequency herbs. The reliability of frequency estimation was analyzed by confidence intervals to avoid small-sample errors. Robustness of cluster analysis: The sensitivity of parameters in the entropy clustering (such as the selection of threshold δ) was evaluated. The stability of core combinations was observed by adjusting the parameters multiple times and repeating the clustering process. The silhouette coefficient and cluster stability index were used to evaluate the clustering quality by measuring the average intra-cluster distance and the inter-cluster distance. Quantitative evaluation of association rules: The support and confidence of herbal pairs and core combinations were calculated, and the strength of the association was determined using the lift metric. The a priori algorithm and Frequent-Pattern-Growth (FP-Growth) algorithm were used for 2-way verification of the statistical significance for high frequency combinations. Time-trend analysis: The data of the patents from different time periods (such as every 10 years) was analyzed to determine the stability of high frequency herbal combinations and exclude historical biases. The results of research studies have shown the importance of promoting blood circulation and removing stasis in the treatment of breast hyperplasia: Efficacy frequency (Table  Herbs with promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis effects are often used to treat phlegm and fire stasis, accumulation of lumps caused by  MGH is an endocrine system disorder mainly caused by abnormal hormone secretion leading to a hormonal imbalance. MGH patients have significantly increased estradiol (E The herbs that promote blood circulation and remove blood stasis exert their breast protective effects by regulating the levels of various hormones, including E E Herbs with promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis effects improve MGH by increasing the expression of proapoptotic proteins or decreasing the expression of antiapoptotic proteins. The B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) apoptosis regulator family of proteins and cysteine aspartic protease (caspase) family of proteins play an important regulatory role in the process of apoptosis. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA) can promote the growth and proliferation of endothelial cells and increase the permeability of blood vessels. VEGFA and fibroblast growth factor 1 are highly expressed in patients with breast hyperplasia, and can stimulate angiogenesis through common mechanisms in vivo and in vitro, and are important indicators of angiogenesis. TCM assumes that the main cause of MGH lies in  The  It is believed in TCM that  The frequency of herbs with liver soothing effect was 526 (Table  The expression of angiogenic factors (e.g., VEGFA, FGF2) is closely related to the occurrence and development of breast hyperplasia. VEGFA can not only increase the permeability of vascular endothelial cells, but also induce the development of new mechanisms and new blood vessels by increasing vascular permeability. FGF2 is a direct inducer of angiogenesis, which can promote the regeneration of epidermal cells and endothelial cells, induce the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells and detach them from the basement membrane, which in turn induce chemotaxis of endothelial cells towards breast variant cells. Herbs with liver soothing effect inhibit the proliferation of breast cells by downregulating the expression of angiogenic factors (VEGFA and FGF2), thereby improving pituitary and ovarian function, regulating endocrine function, and improving microcirculation and local blood circulation. Herbs with liver soothing effect can not only promote the metabolism of E Soothing the liver can adjust the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, adjust the cortisol level, and thus alleviate the chronic stress state, thereby improving the abnormal mood of MGH patients, so as to achieve the purpose of healing.

Herbs with  Herbs with  The results revealed that the herbs with heat-clearing and detoxification properties have a large number in MGH effective patents: herbs with heat-clearing properties (985, Table  According to the medical theory of the Zhuang ethnic minority in China, there are 3 important avenues (heaven, earth, and human) and 2 pathways (blood transportation, and information sensing) in the human body. An unobstructed state is important for the 3 important avenues and 2 pathways, which results in the harmony of  “Poison” is a general term in the medical theory of the Zhuang ethnic minority in China. Whether the virus causes a disease after invading human body depends on the virulence strength and the human health status. If the virulence is too strong or the physical condition of the host is poor, the body energy and evil poison compete with each other, but the body energy is powerless against the evil poison, thus the 3 important avenues (heaven, earth, human) and 2 pathways (blood transportation, information sensing) are blocked by the evil poison, which results in diseases. MGH is mainly caused by the invasion of wind poison, cold poison, wet poison, heat poison and other toxic pathogens, which stagnate in the viscera and bone marrow, and obstruct the 3 important avenues and 2 pathways. The accumulation of evil poison leads to heat and swelling pain; thus the ways of clearing heat and detoxification are common treatments for MGH. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a processivity factor for the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase responsible for the synthesis of the DNA leading strand in DNA replication, which is essential for timely and faithful replication of DNA genome, The expression of PCNA is related to cell cycle, and is the weakest in the static stage, but active in the proliferating and transmutation stages. The PCNA index is one of the important indexes to evaluate the proliferative state of the cell. One of the pathological manifestations of MGH is the hyperplasia of catheter epithelial cells and interstitial fibrous tissue. The hyperplastic breast tissue is in a highly active proliferation state, and the expression of PCNA is significantly increased. Herbs with heat-clearing and detoxification properties can inhibit the PCNA protein synthesis and gene expression by preventing cell entry into the S-phase and inducing the DNA synthesis, which reduce the E The results of research studies have shown that the herbs’ frequency for reducing lumps and dispersing knots was 938 (Table  The results of research studies have shown that the herbs’ frequency of eliminating phlegm was 440 (Table  Sputum stagnation is an important etiology and pathogenesis of MGH.

Medical pair and core combination of herbs are commonly used and relatively fixed forms of herbal combination in clinical practice, and are the smallest prescription unit, which have the basic function of prescriptions and show the overall efficacy of prescriptions. The study on its compatibility combinations is of great value to reveal the compatibility laws and scientific connotations of prescriptions. Among the effective patents of herbal prescriptions, the combinations of promoting  The herbal combination of promoting blood circulation and promoting  Activating blood circulation in combination with activating  The activity of super oxide dismutase (SOD) in MGH tissue clearly decreases, while the content of the lipid peroxidation metabolite malondialdehyde (MDA) increases. The combination of promoting blood circulation and promoting  Among the effective patents of herbal prescriptions for preventing and treating breast hyperplasia, the combination of nourishing blood and promoting blood circulation is widely used (Table  Supplementing blood and promoting blood circulation are mainly aimed at the type of nutrient deficiency and excess of pathogenic factors in MGH, namely the type of blood deficiency and stasis. Blood deficiency refers to insufficient blood storage, and results in a decrease in the nutritional and nourishing function of blood, which lead to dysfunction of organs and tissues due to loss of nourishment. The dysfunction of the liver in storing blood and regulating blood volume leads to abnormal blood flow, blood leaves the meridians and remains outside the veins, which causes blood stasis. Blood stasis does not go, new blood is not produced, so the cycle is repeated, which is the type of blood deficiency and blood stasis obstruction in breast hyperplasia. Patients usually have breast lumps, pain like acupuncture, pale face, dry and rough skin, withered hair, brittle claws dim vision, numbness of hands and feet, poor flexion and extension of limbs, palpitations, insomnia, dreaminess, forgetfulness. Herbs that can nourish blood and are used to treat blood deficiency are called blood tonics. It is mild in nature, sweet in taste, and belongs to the liver, spleen, and kidney meridians. The pharmacological effects of preventing and treating MGH are as follows: improve bone marrow hematopoietic function; resistance to hypoxia; dilating coronary artery, reducing myocardial oxygen consumption, increasing myocardial blood flow; nourishing blood and liver, reducing serum transaminases, increasing liver glycogen, and improving liver microcirculation. Blood stasis is related to various pathological factors, including blood viscosity, disorders of microcirculation and blood circulation, platelet activation and adhesion aggregation, abnormal tissue cell metabolism and immune function metabolism, etc. Herbs that have the effects of unblocking blood vessels, dispelling blood stasis, and treating blood stasis blockages are called blood activating and stasis resolving herbs. These herbs have a relatively mild nature (soft nature, slightly cold, or slightly warm), enter 3 meridians (heart, liver, and spleen). They have the functions of promoting blood circulation, relieving pain, regulating menstruation, removing blood stasis and removing ecchymosis spots. The pharmacological action of herbs for promoting blood circulation and resolving blood stasis in the treatment of MGH are as follows: improving blood rheology and preventing thrombosis; improving microvascular status and blood flow; reducing the permeability of capillaries, reducing or clearing blood leakage around microvessels; reducing serum total cholesterol, neutral fat, and β-lipoprotein; and improving hemodynamics, dilating peripheral blood vessels, and increasing organ blood flow. Among the effective patents’ herbal pairs, there were many herbs for reducing swelling, dispersing nodules, and purulent drainage combined with herbs for promoting blood circulation (Table  In TCM theory it is believed that blood is the carrier of  Chinese herbs for promoting blood circulation and dispersing nodules can effectively improve breast blood circulation, reduce blood viscosity, alleviate pain, inhibit glandular hyperplasia, and promote fibrous tissue absorption. They can adjust the liver’s ability to inactivate hormones, improve liver and systemic blood circulation, and promote hormone metabolism in the body. Herbs for resolving phlegm, softening hardness, and dispersing nodules can promote the absorption of pathological products and inflammatory exudates, promote the dissipation of fibrous tissue and other substances around the glands, thus inhibiting breast gland hyperplasia. The iodine components in herbs for reducing swelling and dissipating nodules can stimulate the production of P in the anterior pituitary gland, reduce estrogen levels in the body, thus can be used to treat breast hyperplasia. It was recorded in  The main components of  Angelica polysaccharides can affect the hematopoietic system, and significantly promote the proliferation and differentiation of mouse hematopoietic stem cells (Colony-Forming Unit-Spleen), mouse and human myeloid progenitor cells (Burst-Forming Unit-Erythroid, Colony-Forming Unit-Erythroid, Colony-Forming Unit-Granulocyte/Macrophage, and Colony-Forming Unit-Megakaryocyte). Bone marrow macrophages induced by  It can protect against radiation-induced oxidative damage of bone marrow mononuclear cells, promote the recovery of hematopoietic function and the increase of blood cells, which have obvious protective effects on radiation-induced hematopoietic injury. In addition, it can significantly enhance the expression of VEGFA, enhance the proliferative capacity of bone marrow stem cells, and reduce their apoptosis, which accelerates the recovery of hematopoietic function from acute radiation-induced injury in multiple ways.

Second, when the body’s positive energy is deficient, the body’s immune function is impaired. It is also the main type of MGH.  Third,  Safflower is the dry tubular flower of the Asteraceae plant ( The main components of Safflower are flavin, glycoside, Safflower pigment, quinone glycoside, neosafflower glycoside, Safflower oil chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, catechol, pyrocatechol, etc. Safflower can dilate arteries, prevent coagulation and thrombus, increase coronary blood flow and myocardial nutrient blood flow, inhibit platelet aggregation, enhance fibrinolysis, and reduce WBV. Safflower flavin has inhibitory effects on ADP-induced platelet aggregation, as well as deaggregation on ADP-aggregated platelets. Safflower flavin can significantly prolong plasma calcium recovery time, PT and coagulation time. It also affects the coagulation system in vivo and in vitro, and has very significant inhibitory effects on thrombus, which can improve microcirculation, protect against inflammation and platelet aggregation, as well as effectively enhance the body’s cellular immunity, humoral immunity and nonspecific immune function. Safflower oil also has the effect of reducing blood lipids.

      "title": "CGRP-Targeted Migraine Therapies in Patients With Vascular Risk Factors or Stroke",
      "content": "Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)–targeted therapies, including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and gepants, represent a major advancement in migraine prevention, offering greater efficacy and improved tolerability compared with traditional treatments. These agents selectively inhibit the CGRP pathway, a key mediator in migraine pathophysiology, and are increasingly used even as first-line options in selected patients. While clinical trials and real-world data suggest a favorable cardiovascular (CV) safety profile, particularly in patients without major risk factors, evidence remains limited for those with established vascular disease or recent vascular events. Concerns persist regarding long-term effects and the safety of CGRP blockade in high-risk populations. This narrative review focuses on the CV and cerebrovascular safety of CGRP-targeted migraine treatments—an area of growing clinical relevance. We compare these newer agents with traditional migraine preventives and highlight the paucity of data in patients with previous stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, or significant CV comorbidities. In addition, we discuss the emerging topic of dual CGRP pathway blockade (mAbs plus gepants), which has not previously been reviewed in the context of vascular risk. Based on currently available scientific evidence, we offer structured clinical considerations to guide the use of CGRP-targeted therapies in patients with vascular risk or cerebrovascular disease. Our aim is to support informed decision making in a population that has often been excluded from clinical trials but is becoming increasingly important in clinical practice. Migraine is the second most prevalent debilitating disorder among young individuals. Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide and the leading cause of long-term disability. Approximately two-thirds of all strokes are ischemic, and one-third is hemorrhagic. Shared Risk Factors of Stroke and Migraine Abbreviations: CRP = C-reactive protein; CSD = cortical spreading depression; IL = interleukin; PFO = patent foramen ovale. A comprehensive search was conducted on MEDLINE using the terms “stroke,” “CGRP,” “gepants,” and “monoclonal antibodies,” combined with the linking word “AND.” Abstracts were then screened for relevance to the topic, and full-text articles were reviewed to extract relevant information and for relevant references. All recommendations in the discussion are the consensus of the authors, based on current evidence. Currently, 2 types of CGRP pathway–targeting medications are available: monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and gepants. For episodic and chronic migraine treatment, 4 mAbs are approved: eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab. The migraine preventive effect of erenumab is caused by the mAb's binding affinity to the extracellular canonical CGRP receptor, whereas eptinezumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab bind to the endogenous CGRP ligand, respectively. Given their half-life of approximately 28–32 days, the administration of erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab requires a monthly subcutaneous application. By contrast, eptinezumab is administered IV at 3-month intervals, and for high-dose fremanezumab, every 3-month subcutaneous application is possible. The orally or nasally administered gepants directly interact with the CGRP receptor by binding one of the subunits of the canonical CGRP receptor. In comparison with mAbs, gepants show a by far shorter half-life (from 5 to 11 hours) and can be used for acute migraine treatment and/or preventative migraine treatment. Atogepant and rimegepant are approved for preventive migraine treatment. Notably, rimegepant can be used as acute migraine and preventive migraine medication. Rimegepant for preventive use is taken every other day while atogepant is taken daily. Ubrogepant and rimegepant for acute migraine use should be taken similar to triptans. Zavegepant is the first gepant that is applied nasally for acute migraine attack termination. In healthy participants, mAbs cannot penetrate the BBB to a relevant amount, which is due to their high molecular weight. In summary, CGRP-targeting migraine therapies have been demonstrated to exhibit a significantly reduced side-effect profile and higher efficacy in reducing MHDs in comparison with conventional migraine preventatives. This assertion is substantiated by the findings of the randomized, double-blind HERMES trial, which conducted a comparative analysis between erenumab and topiramate. They also have a much favorable benefit-risk ratio, especially in the largest migraine patient group: young women of childbearing age. The use of mAbs and gepants targeting the CGRP system has proven to be an effective, safe, and well-tolerated approach for reducing migraine attacks. Recent studies have extended follow-up periods beyond 2 years and included patients with CV risk factors. For example, an analysis of AEs associated with erenumab showed low incidences of ischemic CV and cerebrovascular events, with similar rates across different 10-year CV risk categories. A recent study In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 88 participants with stable angina received either an IV infusion of erenumab (140 mg) or placebo, followed by an exercise treadmill test. An observational cohort study assessed the CV safety of erenumab and fremanezumab over at least 1 year. In Europe, the EudraVigilance database confirmed that CV adverse drug reactions linked to anti-CGRP therapies align with existing literature. Because gepants represent the latest approved targeted migraine therapies, study data beyond comprehensive approval studies are scarce. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study with 22 healthy male volunteers, no vasoconstrictive effect of telcagepant was identified, when the participants were orally administered 500 mg of telcagepant (representing the second highest dose of telcagepant studied in RCTs) or placebo. In phase 3 trials for atogepant, rimegepant, and ubrogepant, no increase in CV AEs among treated patients have been reported. Selected Meta-Analyses and Clinical and Preclinical Trials Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Monoclonal Antibodies and Gepants in Migraine Treatment Abbreviations: AE = adverse event; CV = cardiovascular; CVD = cardiovascular disease; FMD = flow-mediated dilation; mAb = monoclonal antibody; RCT = randomized controlled trial; VMR = vasomotor reactivity. A case report describes a 41-year-old woman with episodic migraine without aura who received preventive mAb therapy with erenumab 70 mg. Two case reports have described reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) in women who were undergoing preventive therapy with fremanezumab The results of the large RCTs, which enrolled more than 10,000 patients with migraine, did not indicate any relevant increase in CV risk in patients who received mAbs or gepants. This is a significant finding, given that RCTs represent the highest level of evidence in medicine. In addition, the combination of CGRP-targeting therapies with potentially vasoconstrictive triptans or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is safe in RCTs and in real-world data. However, preclinical studies have indicated an elevated risk for individuals under CGRP-targeted therapies and acute vascular events, such as stroke, at least in animal models. Because these treatments have been emerging over the past 5 years and might become the first-line treatment in patients with migraine, careful evaluation of CV safety in patients need to be studied further. The 3 case reports described above do not prove direct causality between stroke or RCVS and CGRP-interfering treatment. However, it is crucial to consider the implications for patients using these migraine preventive therapies in acute stroke settings. It has been proposed that CGRP blockage may affect cerebral hemodynamics in clinical responders to mAb preventive treatment, with lower cerebral blood-flow velocity (a marker for decreased CBF) observed in this subgroup. This leads us to consider how we might best approach the treatment of stroke patients who are currently receiving CGRP-targeted therapies. It seems prudent to suggest that treatment with CGRP pathway mAbs or gepants should be paused immediately. After (ischemic) stroke, the reintroduction of CGRP pathway–targeted therapies may be reconsidered after a thorough evaluation of the potential benefits and harms in each individual patient. Establishing a precise time frame for discontinuing CGRP pathway–targeting drugs after stroke is challenging because poststroke remodeling is an individual and dynamic process. Motor recovery after stroke typically occurs within the first 3 months, whereas other remodeling processes can last up to 1 year. Based on existing data, it can be assumed that patients aged 65 years or younger without relevant CVD will not exhibit an increased risk of stroke due to CGRP-interfering drugs per se. This assumption is based on > 10,000 patients in phase 1–3 RCTs, postmarketing studies, long-term observational studies, and large migraine registries. However, as society in industrialized countries ages, an increasing number of people with migraine will face CVD. Various tools, such as the atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) score, have been developed to estimate a patient's risk of experiencing a CV event within the next 10 years. This score considers factors such as age; sex; ethnicity; cholesterol levels; blood pressure; smoking status; diabetes mellitus; and current use of hypertension, statin, and aspirin therapies. Despite these variables, determining whether a patient can safely undergo CGRP-targeted therapy cannot be conclusively answered based on the ASCVD score alone. The (patho)physiology of CGRP is complex, presenting a challenging decision-making process. Nonetheless, we agree that there are certain groups of patients who should avoid CGRP-targeted therapies, including those with small vessel disease, distal artery stenosis, and uncontrolled hypertension and patients having RP. Clinical Guidance Suggested in Patients With Acute and Postacute Stroke and Patients Facing Stroke Risk Abbreviations: ASCVD = atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; CGRP = calcitonin gene-related peptide; CV = cardiovascular; CVD = cardiovascular disease; mAb = monoclonal antibody; NSAID = nonsteroidal inflammatory drug; RCT = randomized controlled trial; RP = Raynaud phenomenon; SAH = subarachnoid hemorrhage. It would be beneficial for future investigations to comprise animal and human data on a multidisciplinary level to gain a deeper understanding of the safe use of CGRP-targeting therapies. It is also important to recognize the vital role that neurologists play in diagnosing and treating migraine patients effectively over time. Although evidence about a dual blockade of the CGRP pathway with mAbs for preventive treatment and gepants for acute migraine treatment is scarce, increasing numbers of people with migraine have been using this kind of therapy. Because dual CGRP blockade represents the latest possibility in migraine prevention and acute treatment, only a handful of studies exist evaluating the efficacy and safety of this combination. Erenumab or galcanezumab for preventive use and ubrogepant for acute use were evaluated in an open-label label study with a follow-up of 45 days with no reported CV concerns. In summary, CGRP has been found to play a profound role in migraine pathogenesis but also covers beneficial tissue-protecting roles in CVD, especially in stroke. Current data of large RCTs do not suggest any elevation in stroke risk per se; however, data of people with preexisting CVD receiving CGRP-targeted treatment are scarce. As mAb preventive migraine treatment might become first-line treatment, evidence-based data of older patients (≥65 years) and people facing comorbidities need to be established. Based on current data, we suggest the following approach for 3 different scenarios: In patients with acute stroke or SAH, all CGRP-targeted treatments should be paused immediately. Reinitiation of CGRP-targeted treatment needs to be evaluated particularly by the patients' stroke etiology and other CV comorbidities. A treatment pause of a minimum of 3 months needs to be respected, and patients with small vessel disease should not undergo CGRP-targeted treatment. In older patients with preexisting CV comorbidities, traditional migraine preventives (e.g., beta-blockers) should be preferred. If CGRP-targeted treatment is still considered, gepants should be preferred because of their shorter half-life. mAbs or gepants should not be used in patients with small vessel disease or RP at all.",

      "title": "A feasibility study on non-invasive and non-contact jugular venous pulse measurement using 60 GHz FMCW radar",
      "content": "The jugular venous pulse (JVP) reflects right atrial pressure and provides diagnostic insight into cardiovascular and pulmonary health. However, reliable assessment remains difficult due to neck adiposity, anatomical variability and suboptimal positioning. Although central venous catheterization is the gold standard, its invasive nature restricts routine or long-term use. This study introduces a non-invasive method for JVP estimation using a 60 GHz frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar. The system captures venous pulsations at the skin surface and applies eigenbeamforming to enhance signal-to-noise ratio and pulse clarity. Radar parameters were optimized for signal fidelity and validated through morphological comparison with simultaneously recorded photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. Additionally, we compared radar-derived JVP signals with previously recorded catheterization data from a patient with early-stage heart failure to assess clinical relevance. Signal localization was successfully achieved within a direction-of-arrival (DoA) range of  Heart failure (HF) occurs when the heart is unable to pump the required amount of blood adequately to meet the demands of the entire body. This condition can arise because of either the heart’s inability to fill with an adequate blood volume or a weakened capacity to pump effectively. HF can potentially impair the functionality of vital organs, such as the brain, liver and kidneys. In Australia, approximately 15% of hospitalizations have been attributed to HF [ HF, also known as congestive heart failure (CHF), results in impaired blood pumping and venous congestion due to blood backing up into systemic and pulmonary veins. Right-sided HF is particularly associated with elevated venous pressure and gradual symptom onset, emphasizing the importance of right ventricular assessment. The jugular venous pulse (JVP) serves as a key indicator, offering insights into venous pressure and right heart abnormalities such as atrial fibrillation or tricuspid valve disorders [ As shown in  ( Traditional JVP estimation is invasive and limited mainly to critically ill patients in intensive or coronary care settings because of the high risk of complications. Traditionally, the IJV has been preferred for JVP assessment due to concerns that valves in the EJV may interfere with accurate measurements. However, this view is outdated. The IJV also contains valves that do not hinder pressure evaluation and may even enhance the visibility of venous waveforms by amplifying atrial pulsations, as noted by Steven McGee [ Non-invasive approaches for JVP estimation have explored PPG, though its reliability is often hindered by sensitivity to skin and tissue properties, which complicates calibration [ This study, for the first time, employs a 60 GHz frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar for non-contact JVP assessment. The higher operating frequency provides enhanced spatial resolution and sensitivity to subtle surface displacements. The Infineon BGT60TR13C radar module was selected for its integrated antenna-in-package design, reduced interference susceptibility, and flexible parameter configuration. Furthermore, this work is the first to utilize the Sim4Life platform from ZMT Zurich MedTech AG to investigate the impact of RF electromagnetic fields on the neck region, specifically in the context of high-frequency radar for JVP monitoring. The key innovation lies in combining 60 GHz FMCW radar sensing with electromagnetic simulations to assess specific absorption rate (SAR) and power density (PD), supporting a safe and clinically applicable method for non-invasive JVP monitoring via the EJV. The most common and widely available method for measuring JVP is cannulation, an invasive technique considered the gold standard. In this procedure, an experienced anaesthesiologist inserts venous catheters into the right internal jugular or subclavian vein (SVC). These catheters are then connected to a multi-modular monitor via a pressure transducer. After zeroing the transducer to the heart level, the mean venous pressure (mm Hg) is displayed in real-time on the monitor and recorded as invasive venous pressure [ Invasive methods can lead to various complications related to vascular access and typically require trained and skilled physicians. Non-invasive techniques for JVP assessment are broadly categorized into intermittent and continuous methods. Continuous monitoring is particularly valuable for remote cardiac care. Several recent approaches employ pressure sensors, ultrasound, PPG and accelerometry. Ultrasound imaging of the IJV is the most established method, offering real-time clinical insights [ To address these limitations, García-López  Other modalities include accelerometer-based sensing, which captures skin vibrations linked to jugular and carotid flow [ In the broader context of PPG-based cardiovascular assessment, Elgendi  Non-invasive monitoring of the JVP has advanced through various contactless techniques. Amelard  Further innovations include Tang  Microwave radar technologies have also been explored. A prototype utilizing 24 GHz radar demonstrated the feasibility of JVP measurement; however, challenges in qualitative pulse interpretation persist [ FMCW radar systems, at higher frequencies, have emerged as a viable solution for non-contact JVP monitoring. These systems can detect minute surface motions associated with cardiac activity, offering high-resolution data without direct skin contact [ The adoption of FMCW radar technology holds promise for remote and continuous monitoring of heart failure patients, potentially reducing the need for frequent hospital visits and enabling timely clinical interventions. This study aims to validate the efficacy of a 60 GHz FMCW radar system for non-invasive JVP assessment, evaluating its performance through experimental data and exploring its potential for broader clinical application. This study utilizes a commercially available 60 GHz FMCW radar sensor (BGT60TR13C, Infineon Technologies AG) as shown in  ( To assess electromagnetic interactions and safety, we employed the Sim4Life simulation platform (ZMT Zurich MedTech AG) [ Optimal radar placement is essential to ensure signal strength without saturation or loss of detail due to distance. To maximize physiological signal detection, we first identified the most suitable neck location for targeting the jugular vein. Given that venous return and pressure dynamics are influenced by gravity, the jugular pulse is best observed at a reclined angle between 30° and 45°. To guide positioning, we referred to small intestine (SI) acupuncture points SI16 and SI17, as shown in  To validate system sensitivity, we simulated JVP-like movement using a speaker plate facing the radar and emitting a synthetic beat signal composed of two frequencies ( As shown in  A speaker plate, positioned to face the radar, simulates a patient target in this experimental set-up. The experiment involves the synthesis of an audio signal, meticulously composed of two specific frequencies, 50 Hz and 54 Hz, to evaluate the radar system's response. This integrated material and system design approach enables both safety validation and signal fidelity assessment, laying the foundation for reliable non-contact JVP monitoring using high-frequency radar. The workflow for the detection of the JVP is described in this section. The data cube contains the normalized ADC samples of the received signal. Each frame of data consists of the number of receiving antennas ( Flowchart of the data processing sequence. After reshaping the raw data, an FFT is performed on the samples to obtain the range information. Upon computation of FFT, displacement is calculated from the phase variation, which is then used to extract the JVP. Below, we detail each step in the signal processing sequence, accompanied by the corresponding pseudo-codes. The raw data vector is first reshaped into a matrix. FFT processing was applied to every chirp pulse in each frame and to each antenna. (The optional windowing technique can be used before the FFT for spectrum interpolation.) The FFT outputs are averaged to reduce the noise effect for each antenna signal and from each frame. From the averaged spectrum of the raw data, each antenna detected the first spike as a radar echo from the patient’s skin. The inverse fourier transform (IFFT) of first spectrum bin to extract IQ complex signal for each antenna. The FFT is performed separately for the best two antennas (1 and 3) in terms of their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Additionally, the averaging process is crucial here for noise reduction and signal clarity enhancement. While the I/Q extraction process follows the approach in [ Eigen-beamforming is widely used in radar and communication systems for directionally selective reception [ Selecting this modified version of beamforming is due to one bin selection from the FFT-range function, which induces pure sine wave function as an I/Q signal. In such one bin output signal, very low noise contribution is observed in the IQ signal, which implies an almost noise-free observation vector  is by definition a rank-one matrix, and with almost noise-free observation, this covariance matrix is ill-conditioned (the ratio of the highest eigenvalue to the smallest eigenvalue is much greater than 1) and hence non-invertible. Constructing the steering vector (vector of signal phases in each receiving antenna) for a given direction of Arrival  The received signal power at the output of the beamformer is calculated with respect to the angle  such that: This last expression is a  To address the noisy circular pattern in the I/Q plane, Taubin circular regression with a singular value decomposition (SVD) based implementation was employed to correct offset and noise. See electronic supplementary material, figure S6 in section S6. This method was selected for its robustness and reduced algebraic error, offering greater accuracy than traditional least squares approaches [ To extract the phase variation of reflected radar echoes caused by skin displacement, we extract the first instantaneous phase of the output signal from our eigen-beamformer. This instantaneous phase must be unwrapped to retrieve its linearly growing nature over time. Only phase fast variation, rather than linear behaviour of the instantaneous phase, carries information about the jugular pulse. To extract these variations, we use phase differences between successive phase samples. Skin displacement is related to phase variation using wave number  Studies have reported that the visibility of most of the JVP components falls below 4 Hz [ In this section, we present a detailed discussion of the simulation outcomes along with the data analysis results. The data analysis section covered both time and frequency domain analyses at various inclinations, along with a comparison between the JVP and the PPG signal. Additionally, we compared the spectrum of the non-invasive JVP measurements with data obtained from the right heart catheterization (RHC) method. The SAR and PD reduce with the increase in distance for high frequencies. In the design operation of our device, we have carefully maintained a 2 mm distance between the radar and the skin surface. This specific distance has been chosen to ensure that the SAR and PD values are kept within safe and acceptable limits [ For our experiment, the selection of antennas was guided by the SNR criterion. This SNR metric, which correlates to the amount of reflected energy captured, is influenced by the positioning of the antennas relative to the vein. The optimal antenna configuration is the one that positions the vein equidistantly between the selected pair of antennas. From the FFT analysis, the first FFT-range bin was chosen as the logical reference point, corresponding to the initial radar reflection from the closest obstacle, typically the skin. The other reflections (i.e. bins) relate to the other obstacles present in the environment. For reference, see electronic supplementary material, figure S8 in section S6. Our study explores a proof-of-concept technology for JVP detection using varying radar parameters, such as samples/chirp, chirps/frame and sampling frequency. Our findings, illustrated in  Detected JVP waveforms (red) overlaid on the full signal (blue); inset zooms into a JVP waveform marked by points indicating the ascent and descent of the waveform, respectively. The quality of the JVP signal changes with the body’s inclination, and this phenomenon is physiological. In a healthy person, the visible jugular veins are fully collapsed when standing and are often distended to a variable degree when the person is supine. Selecting an appropriate intermediate position permits the top of the column to become visible in the neck between the clavicle and the mandible. So, as the angle increases, the carotid pulse is expected to be more dominant compared with JVP, overshadowing its features. Analyses of JVP signal at both time ( Comparison of JVP and PPG signals from synchronized measurements, highlighting temporal alignment and amplitude differences between JVP and PPG pulsations. As a proof-of-concept feasibility study, the experiment was ethically limited to a healthy subject. While cardiac catheterization remains the gold standard for JVP assessment, it is invasive and typically reserved for critically ill patients. To provide comparative insight, we analysed RHC data from a patient with TR—an early marker of CHF, and compared its spectral characteristics with the JVP signal from our healthy subject. This comparison highlights waveform differences between normal and early-stage CHF conditions. In  Frequency spectrum comparison of RHC CVP signal and sensor recorded JVP signal. Both spectra are shown in normalized amplitude (dB) over a frequency range, emphasizing the frequency components and amplitudes that are characteristic of cardiovascular waveforms. Of note, CVP is an invasive measure, and JVP is a non-invasive measure that reflects the right atrial pressure. Due to the non-invasive nature, there will be timing delays and attenuation because of the distance between the jugular vein and the right atrium. Also, JVP can be influenced by factors like the patient’s position, neck angle and even breathing pattern, which might not directly affect CVP. Nonetheless, the correlation between them confirms that JVP can serve as a useful non-invasive estimate for understanding right heart health. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using a 60 GHz FMCW radar for non-invasive JVP extraction. The radar’s high resolution, integrated antenna design and sensitivity to subtle skin displacements make it well-suited for detecting venous pulsations. All recordings utilized the maximum bandwidth of 5.5 GHz in close-range measurements. JVP signal quality was found to depend on radar–subject distance. Too close a placement caused overlap between the initial reflection and the DC component in the FFT spectrum, while excessive distance diminished signal amplitude. An optimal spacing of approximately 2 mm was maintained. Additionally, inter-bin mixing effects and hardware constraints—particularly the tight coupling between sampling frequency and chirp configuration—necessitated precise tuning of system parameters. At least eight chirps were required to reliably extract phase information due to the radar’s fast chirp generation characteristics. These findings highlight the potential of high-frequency radar for integration into non-contact clinical monitoring systems, offering a promising alternative to invasive techniques for early cardiovascular assessment. Through meticulous evaluation, we established the subsequent configuration for JVP estimation with this radar: Higher sampling rate for a fast time (higher number of samples per chirp) to increase FFT-range resolution. Because a lower value implies a reduction of the signal quality and even burying the signal in noise. Suppress averaging on FFT-range spectrums over all chirps to avoid losing JVP signal details. Higher frame rate to get more time resolution for JVP signal. In some situations, a signal with low SNR in one antenna can significantly reduce the performance of the beamformer and, eventually, the pulse detection. Therefore, an antenna selection procedure must be adopted. Also, a shorter chirp duration is helpful because if the chirp is longer, the chirp reflection collides with the transmitted one. Therefore, for better results, we narrowed down the parameter values in  Radar configuration for optimal JVP estimation. parameter value/condition number of samples per chirp 128 or the highest possible value frame rate 250 Hz or the closest possible value number of chirps per frame chirp duration 0.00013 s or closest possible value The receiver chip employs only an in-phase (I) mixer, producing a real-valued intermediate frequency (IF) signal without a quadrature (Q) component. Applying a Fourier transform yields complex I/Q data, enabling phase analysis across frequencies. However, this architecture is susceptible to signal fading caused by phase offsets between the reference and reflected signals, limiting its temporal accuracy compared with true I/Q radar systems. Through the configuration illustrated in  The original beat signal exhibits a pronounced spike thanks to its high amplitude. By contrast, radar-based beat reconstruction reveals an inconsistent envelope signal stemming from the phase difference between the received signal and the local oscillator. This experiment not only confirms the effectiveness of our algorithm but also sheds light on the constraints related to the hardware (see electronic supplementary material S6, figure S9). Therefore, we prefer to use a sensor equipped with an IQ mixer for future experiments. JVP signals are often obscured by dominant arterial or respiratory components, complicating their isolation and analysis. While Suzuki  While this work provides insight into the feasibility of a contactless and non-invasive JVP measurement, there are some potential challenges and limitations to consider. This proof-of-concept study needs to follow the usual clinical validation pathway for medical devices and technology, in which a control and target cohort will be recruited and studied against the gold standard (baseline). Our ongoing efforts aim to clinically gather evidence of the system’s efficacy with target and control cohorts of participants within a clinical setting through extensive analysis and validation. This study occurs before a proper clinical trial, which can be relatively quick due to this technology’s potentially favourable regulatory classification because of its non-invasive, contactless and low-risk features. It is also required to enhance the radar system’s signal-to-noise performance and explore the integration of automated signal-processing techniques. Also, we plan to incorporate wavelet-based techniques [ This study demonstrates the feasibility of using a 60 GHz FMCW radar for non-invasive JVP estimation, offering a compact and cost-effective alternative to conventional methods. We conducted simulation analyses across multiple frequencies and identified 60 GHz as the most suitable choice for this study. Despite hardware constraints, we successfully identified key signal parameters and validated radar-derived JVP signals through comparison with finger PPG data. A spectral comparison between the estimated JVP signal and catheter-acquired CVP data has also been presented. We also examined the influence of body posture and anatomical variability on signal quality. These findings highlight the radar’s clinical potential, particularly for early heart failure detection in remote settings. Future work will focus on larger cohorts and refining accuracy across diverse physiological conditions.",

      "title": "Laparoscopic treatment of giant ovarian cystic tumors in children: Case report",
      "content": "Ovarian cystic tumors are common in adult women. However, cases of ovarian cystic tumors approximately 30 cm in diameter are rarely reported in adult women and even rarer in children. Here, we report a rare case of a giant ovarian cystic tumor in a 13-year-old girl. A 13-year-old girl was admitted to hospital with abdominal pain and distension for 7 days. The parents felt anxious about the child’s abdominal lesions and requested laparoscopic surgery. After evaluation at our hospital, abdominal color ultrasound and enhanced computer tomography revealed a large sac-like fluid density shadow with clear edges in the abdomen, approximately 38 cm × 35 cm × 24 cm in size. We performed a laparoscopic resection of the cystic ovarian tumor, which was pathologically confirmed as a benign ovarian tumor. Subsequently, laparoscopic exploration revealed a huge cystic tumor originated from the right ovary with a clear boundary between the tumor and the right ovary. Laparoscopic surgery was used to remove the lesion, and the postoperative recovery and follow-up were uneventful. Cases of ovarian cystic tumors with a diameter of approximately 30 cm are very rare in pediatric patients. Laparoscopic surgery is an essential method for the diagnosis and treatment of giant ovarian cystic tumors and can be used as a first-line treatment. Ovarian cysts are approximately 14% more common in women of reproductive age The patient weighed 124 kg and was 153 cm tall. Vital signs included a heart rate of 121 beats/min, breathing 25 minutes, and blood pressure 141/82 mm Hg. Routine blood tests, including liver, kidney, and coagulation functions were within the normal range. She was admitted with abdominal pain with bloating for 7 days. The abdominal pain was tolerable, with no nausea, vomiting, and her temperature was normal. The parents observed that the abdominal distention of the patient was more evident than that of her twin sister; she had poor exercise tolerance and tired easily. Abdominal computer tomography (CT) was performed and detected a large cystic tumor. The patient had regular menstruation with no obvious abnormality. Her menstruation ended 2 days before admission. There was no family history of any related genetic disease. Abdominal and pelvic ultrasonography of the twin sister showed no abnormalities. The parents felt anxious about the child’s abdominal lesions and requested laparoscopic surgery. After hospitalization, the patient underwent all relevant examinations and tests, and she recovered normally. On physical examination, the patient’s abdomen was distended, a mass measuring approximately 30 cm × 25 cm × 25 cm was palpable, with limited motion and occupying the entire abdomen (Fig.  Figure (A) shows the abdominal distention preoperatively, with the triangle representing the head. Figure (B) represents the disappearance of abdominal distension postoperatively, with the triangle representing the head. Figure (C) shows the incision appearance postoperatively, with the triangle representing the head. (A and B) Abdominal enhanced CT showing large abdominal tumors with triangles. Figure (C) is the sac fluid extracted from the giant ovarian cystic tumor intraoperatively. CT = computer tomography. Based on history, physical examination, imaging, and laboratory examination, the possibility of ovarian cystic tumor was considered. Due to the large size of the tumor and its mainly cystic component, we decided to conduct a laparoscopic surgical exploration. Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in a supine position. A 10 mm incision was made at the lower umbilical margin, and the incision was made into the abdomen by layer. A puncture needle was placed under direct vision to extract the fluid in the cystic tumor slowly, and approximately 13,000 mL was extracted (Fig.  (A) The triangle is the giant cystic tumor of the right ovary specimen, and the arrow is the cyst of the left ovary specimen. Figure (B) shows HE staining of the follicular cyst the right ovarian tumor, with pathological images of ×100, most of the lining epithelial cells of the cyst wall were shed, and the fibrous tissue of the cyst wall was hyperplastic. Figure (C) shows an accessory mesonephric duct of the ovary, HE staining of the left ovarian tumor showed that the cyst wall had single cubic epithelium in the pathological image of ×100. HE = hematoxylin and eosin. Figure  The nursing roadmap in this paper is shown in Figure  Nursing roadmap. CT = computer tomography. Among ovarian cysts, giant ovarian cysts in children are rare. The specific cause of ovarian cysts is unclear; however, it is believed to be related to environment, diet, endocrine, heredity, and so on. Ovarian cysts can be divided into functional, neoplastic, endometritic, and tubal. Functional cysts are relatively rare in children, mainly luteal and follicular cysts, and most resolve spontaneously under observation or drug intervention. Ovarian cysts have no specific symptoms. A few are found due to torsion, rupture, and acute abdomen, most are inadvertently found during physical examination. Mesenteric and retroperitoneal cystic tumors should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of large cystic tumors in the abdominal cavity of children. Ovarian cyst treatment can be divided into conservative and surgical treatments. Most ovarian cysts are treated conservatively with observation. Ovarian cysts: commonly have a diameter >5 cm, tend to be malignant, and ovarian cyst torsion and other symptoms require surgical treatment. Cases of giant ovarian cystic tumors approximately 30 cm in diameter in children are rare. Complete laparoscopic resection of the tumor was successful. The patient recovered smoothly after surgery, and no recurrence was observed during 1-year follow-up. We hope our report provides clinicians with ideas for diagnosis and treatment to provide better medical care to children. We would like to thank Editage (",

      "title": "Molecular insights into gender-specific differences in rheumatoid arthritis: A study using high-throughput sequencing and Mendelian randomization",
      "content": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multifaceted autoimmune disorder with notable gender differences. The impact of gender-specific genetic variations on RA’s pathogenesis remains unclear. This research investigates gender-specific genes in RA using Mendelian randomization (MR) and transcriptome sequencing to understand RA mechanisms, focusing on gender-specific immune responses. We used the limma package to analyze gender-differential genes in RA patients, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses. Key genes were identified through least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and support vector machine recursive feature elimination, and a diagnostic nomogram was constructed and validated using the gene expression omnibus database. Immune cell and function analyses were performed using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis, and a competing endogenous ribonucleic acid (RNA) network was constructed. MR analysis was used to investigate the causal relationship between gender-differential genes and RA. Thirty differentially expressed genes were identified, with Gene Ontology analysis indicating their involvement in neutrophil-mediated killing. Six key genes (MAP7D2, AR, DNAH6, CXorf36, ORM1, and IQGAP3) were identified, and a diagnostic nomogram was developed (area under the curve: 0.956 in the training set, 0.859 in the validation set  Gender-specific differences in RA: The study identifies significant gender-specific genetic variations in rheumatoid arthritis, with a focus on how these differences influence immune responses. Key gene identification and diagnostic tool: Six key genes (MAP7D2, AR, DNAH6, CXorf36, ORM1, and IQGAP3) were identified as crucial, leading to the development and validation of a diagnostic nomogram with high accuracy. Immune cell analysis: Female RA patients were found to have lower levels of macrophages and neutrophils, highlighting gender-based differences in immune cell function. Mendelian randomization insights: The study used MR analysis to uncover the specific role of the RETN gene in seronegative RA patients, particularly in females. Clinical implications: The findings provide a foundation for developing personalized treatment strategies tailored to the gender-specific mechanisms of RA. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by persistent joint inflammation, leading to pain, functional disability, and systemic complications such as cardiovascular disease, pulmonary fibrosis, and osteoporosis. These manifestations significantly impair patients’ quality of life and survival, with China facing a substantial disease burden of approximately 5 million cases. A striking feature of RA is its pronounced gender disparity: women exhibit a threefold higher incidence than men and often experience more aggressive disease progression. This discrepancy strongly implicates sex-specific biological mechanisms in RA pathogenesis. Recent advances highlight multifaceted interactions between sex hormones, genetic susceptibility, and immune regulation. Estrogen has been shown to amplify Th17-mediated pro-inflammatory responses via ER-α signaling, while androgens like testosterone suppress autoantibody production by promoting Treg differentiation. Current therapies, including conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologics, have improved symptom control but remain limited by variable efficacy, adverse effects (e.g., hepatotoxicity, infections), and a lack of gender-specific treatment guidelines. To bridge this gap, Mendelian randomization (MR) offers a promising solution. As a genetic epidemiology method, MR uses genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) to infer causal relationships, minimizing confounding and reverse causality. In addition, the heterogeneity in clinical outcomes, adverse events, and drug responses between male and female RA patients further underscores the need for sex-aware research strategies. Therefore, this study seeks to systematically explore the sex-specific molecular mechanisms of RA by integrating MR and transcriptomics. We aim to identify RA-related genetic variants with sex-differential effects, detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between male and female patients and controls, and construct a sex-specific regulatory network. This integrative approach aspires to enhance our understanding of RA pathogenesis from a gendered perspective and contribute to the development of personalized treatment strategies, ultimately advancing precision medicine in RA. The workflow of this study was illustrated in Figure  Flowchart of this study. ceRNA = competing endogenous ribonucleic acid, DEGs = differentially expressed genes, GEO = gene expression omnibus, GO = Gene Ontology, KEGG = Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, MR = Mendelian randomization, PBMCs = peripheral blood mononuclear cells, RA = rheumatoid arthritis. The recruitment period for this study began on 16-07-2021 and ended on 31-12-2022. We selected a total of 152 patients with RA who were admitted to the Department of Rheumatology and Immunology at Dazhou Central Hospital from July 2021 to December 2022 as the RA group. There were 123 female patients and 29 male patients. The study protocol, approved by the Ethics Committee of Dazhou Central Hospital (approval number: 2021-022), ensured the ethical conduct of the research. All participants voluntarily took part in the study and provided informed consent. Each participant signed a written consent form. This study adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All methods were conducted in strict compliance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Patients who met the diagnostic criteria for RA according to either the 1987 American College of Rheumatology or the 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism guidelines were included. The age of the participants was ≥18 years, irrespective of gender. Patients with acute or chronic infectious diseases, patients with significant medical conditions affecting the heart, brain, liver, kidney, or blood, patients with malignant tumors or mental disorders, and pregnant or lactating women were excluded. Upon enrollment, a fasting venous blood sample (2.0–3.0 mL) was collected from participants in the RA group. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were then isolated from these samples. RNA was extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China) and assessed for quantity and quality with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Shanghai, China) to meet analysis standards. The RNA sample preparation involved purifying mRNA from total RNA using poly-T magnetic beads, fragmenting it with elevated temperatures and divalent cations, synthesizing 1st strand cDNA with random hexamer primers and M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase, degrading RNA with RNase H, synthesizing 2nd strand cDNA with DNA polymerase I and dNTPs, smoothing DNA fragment ends, adenylating 3′ ends, ligating hairpin loop adaptors, isolating cDNA fragments of 370 to 420 bp via AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter, Beverly), and purifying amplified products to construct the sequencing library. The library, once qualified, was pooled according to effective concentration and desired sequencing volume, then sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. This process generated paired-end reads of 150 bp. The data underwent initial quality checks to ensure suitability for downstream analytical processes. The RA datasets ( We compared gene expression between female and male cohorts using our sequencing data. Differential genes were identified using the “limma” R package (version 3.40.6), applying a threshold of |log2 fold change| > 1 and a false discovery rate < 0.05. We visualized the results with volcano plots and heatmaps, employing the “ggplot2” and “pheatmap” R packages, respectively. We used the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes REST API ( This study employed a dual strategy combining least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) to select gender-associated key genes. In the data preprocessing phase, clinical gender labels were integrated with differential expression data based on sample IDs to construct a standardized expression matrix (Z-score normalization). LASSO regression was implemented using the glmnet package (v4.1-8), with the elastic net parameter set to α = 1 (pure L1 penalty). The regularization path spanned λ = 10⁻⁵ to 10² over 100 logarithmic intervals. Ten-fold stratified cross-validation was used to determine the optimal penalty coefficient (λ.min = 0.008) and to extract the nonzero coefficient genes. SVM-RFE, implemented using the e1071 and msvmRFE packages, After identifying 6 pivotal genes (MAP7D2, AR, DNAH6, CXorf36, ORM1, IQGAP3), logistic regression analysis was conducted to construct a nomogram model, employing the “rms” R package. The diagnostic efficacy of these 6 hub genes was appraised by plotting the ROC curve, utilizing the “ ROCR” R package. The validation of the diagnostic model, predicated on the 6 hub genes, was conducted using the  The infiltration scores of 16 immune cells and the activity levels of 13 immune functions in both female and male RA groups were determined using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) through the “gsva” package in R. These scores were subsequently visualized using heatmaps created with the “pheatmap” package. Interacting miRNAs linked to key DEGs were identified utilizing StarBase ( In this study, we employed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as IVs to investigate the causal relationship between 30DEGs as the exposure and RA as the outcome.

The causal estimate of MR studies must meet the following 3 assumptions: assumption 1, the selected genetic instruments must be powerfully associated with exposure (30 DEGs); assumption 2, the selected genetic instruments are unrelated to the potential confounders; assumption 3, the selected genetic instruments do not affect outcome (rheumatoid arthritis) independently of exposure (30 DEGS). DEGs = differentially expressed genes, KEGG = Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. Our study utilized summary-level data from GWASs of European and Finnish ancestries (Table  For the study of RA, we obtained summary-level GWAS data from the FinnGen consortium ( We employed a series of quality control steps based on GWAS summary results to select appropriate IVs. Initially, SNPs with genome-wide significance ( In this study, we explored the bidirectional causality between 30 DEGs and RA using a 3-sample MR approach. To infer causality, especially with multiple IVs, we employed several methods: inverse-variance weighting (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode. We prioritized the IVW method due to its high statistical power. To ensure the robustness of our findings, we employed various sensitivity analysis methods. Initially, the IVW approach was used to evaluate heterogeneity among IVs, with Cochran’s  We utilized R software (version 4.3.2) for all statistical analyses. To explore the relationship between DEGs and both immune cell infiltration and functional activity, we applied Spearman’s rank correlation. All MR analyses were performed using the “Two-Sample MR” and “MRPRESSO” packages. A  In total, 30 genes were found to be differentially expressed when comparing female and male samples in our sequencing data, of which 11 and 19 were upregulated and downregulated and visualized by the volcano plot and heatmap (Fig.  Functional enrichment analysis indicated that the DEGs were mainly involved in regulation of morphogenesis of an epithelium, regulation of morphogenesis of a branching structure, neutrophil – mediated killing of symbiont cell, neutrophil – mediated killing of bacterium, azurophil granule, primary lysosome, vacuolar lumen, azurophil granule lumen, serine hydrolase activity, serine – type peptidase activity, serine – type endopeptidase activity, heparin binding (Fig.  Functional analyses of the DEGs.

The LASSO and SVM-RFE machine learning algorithms were next implemented to identify hub DEGs capable of reliably differentiating between RA female and male patients. In LASSO analyses with 10-fold cross-validation-based penalty parameter tuning, 16 DEGs were selected (Fig.  Six hub DEGs were identified as diagnostic genes.

In our study, we selected IVs significantly linked to 30 DEGs from GWAS, employing a stringent significance threshold ( We conducted MR analysis on 30 DEGs to explore their potential causal relationships with RA. Among these genes, only the RETN gene showed a significant causal relationship with seronegative RA.

Our findings underscore the importance of sex-specific genetic factors in the pathogenesis of RA, an autoimmune disorder with complex and incompletely understood mechanisms. While previous studies have identified various genes associated with RA, the role of sex-based genetic variations has not been comprehensively explored. The significant differences observed in disease progression and clinical manifestations between male and female patients emphasize the need for a deeper investigation into how sex-specific genetic variations contribute to RA. Understanding these differences could help tailor more effective, gender-specific treatments for RA patients. In our analysis, we identified 30 DEGs between female and male RA patients, with 11 genes upregulated and 19 downregulated. Notable genes included MAP7D2, AR, DNAH6, CXorf36, ORM1, and IQGAP3. Visualization of these findings through volcano and heat maps revealed significant disparities in gene expression ( DEGs also exhibit potential utility in the diagnosis and treatment of RA. Specific DEGs, such as ORM1and AR, could function as novel biomarkers for early diagnosis and monitoring of RA progression. Moreover, these genes may serve as therapeutic targets in personalized medicine, facilitating more tailored treatment strategies for patients of different sexes. Elevated ORM1 expression may promote neutrophil production and activation, worsening joint inflammation and damage. ORM1 also influences inflammatory cytokine release, shaping the local immune environment and advancing RA progression, particularly in female patients, Through ssGSEA analysis, it was found that the levels of immune cell infiltration, including B cells, CD8 After constructing a diagnostic model based on 6 core genes and validating its effectiveness, results showed that the model achieved an AUC of 0.956 in the training set and an AUC of 0.859 in the validation set ( We developed a ceRNA network using 5 diagnostic markers to investigate their regulatory mechanisms, highlighting miRNAs as key epigenetic regulators in RA. The pathways XIST-hsa-miR-124-3p and others may regulate disease progression. In RA, female synovial cells likely transform into fibroblast-like synoviocytes and osteoclasts via LNC-XIST-mediated miRNA modulation, Our MR analysis of 30 DEGs identified RETN as the only gene significantly linked to seronegative RA, showing a significant association ( Our findings highlight the significant role of RETN gene expression in increasing RA risk, particularly among seronegative and female patients. Elevated RETN expression notably heightens RA risk in females, suggesting distinct mechanisms by which RETN influences RA development across genders. This gender-specific effect points to the need for gender-tailored therapeutic approaches and underscores the importance of integrating gender differences into RA research and treatment. Gender disparities in RA are well-established, with women exhibiting a markedly higher incidence and different disease progression than men. Through MR analysis and IVW methods, our study not only confirms the link between the RETN gene and RA but also reveals for the 1st time RETN’s specific role in female RA patients. Elevated RETN expression significantly raises seronegative RA risk in women, reinforcing earlier findings and emphasizing the need to consider gender differences in RA pathogenesis and treatment. The study findings, based on a specific sample, may not be directly generalizable due to genetic, environmental, and demographic variations. Future research should include diverse ethnic and age groups to validate the consistency of gender-specific gene expression and immune response in RA across populations. Additionally, analyzing gene expression at different RA stages – early onset, remission, and flare-up – would help assess the stability of these patterns. Further investigation into varying disease severities would enhance understanding of gene expression’s relationship to disease intensity, improving the model’s applicability for predicting RA risk and progression and supporting personalized treatment. This study has limitations, including a small sample size affecting result generalizability, the need for experimental validation of identified DEGs and ceRNA networks, and further clinical data validation for the machine learning model. Gender differences complicate understanding biological processes, necessitating more research on sex hormones and gene interactions. Although the RETN gene shows promise as a biomarker, translating findings into clinical applications poses challenges. Additionally, confounding factors like lifestyle and genetics may influence results, requiring future studies to address these for accuracy. Continuous research is essential to overcome these limitations and enhance understanding and treatment of RA. This research systematically reveals the significant role of sex-specific genetic variations in the pathogenesis of RA using large-scale sequencing data. Through our analysis, we identified key genes such as DNAH6, ORM1, and AR, which exhibit significant expression differences between genders, indicating distinct molecular mechanisms in male and female RA patients. The diagnostic model built using LASSO and SVM-RFE algorithms effectively distinguished male and female RA patients in the",

      "title": "Anti-CASPR2 meningoencephalitis with thickened dura mater induced by various infections: A case report and literature review",
      "content": "With the update of novel autoantibodies and the expansion of the clinical spectrum, our understanding of autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is rapidly evolving. Anti-CASPR2 meningoencephalitis is a relatively rare condition that may be induced by infections. A young man presented with 3 episodes of meningoencephalitis potentially triggered by possible viral,  Across all 3 episodes, similar clinical manifestations and imaging features were observed. Although autoantibodies in the previous 2 phases were negative, the possibility of infection-related anti-CASPR2 meningoencephalitis remains highly suspected. The treatment regimen comprised antimicrobial agents, corticosteroid therapy, intravenous immunoglobulin, and rituximab administration. Following treatment, the patient’s condition improved with no recurrence to date. Repeat testing showed undetectable anti-CASPR2 immunoglobulin G in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Post-treatment contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the resolution of dural thickening. We further reviewed the mechanism of various infection-related AE and characteristics of CASPR2-related disease. To our knowledge, this is the first report of CASPR2 meningoencephalitis with thickened dura mater, indicating the importance of paying attention to antibody-negative AE and monitor antibodies repeatedly when necessary. In addition to immunotherapy, we recommend comprehensive management throughout the disease process. In recent years, antibody-positive autoimmune encephalitis (AE) has gradually gained public attention. With the update of novel autoantibodies and the expansion of the clinical spectrum, our understanding of AE is rapidly evolving. AE may be related to a variety of infections, including bacteria and viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Anti-CASPR2 meningoencephalitis is a relatively rare condition that can be similarly induced by infections. Different treatment strategies have been applied for CASPR2 encephalitis including steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), plasma exchange, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and/or rituximab. Herein, we detail a case of anti-CASPR2 meningoencephalitis with thickening of the cerebral dura mater, induced by several infections that have not previously been reported. In mid-October 2020, an 18-year-old male presented with bilateral lower extremity muscle soreness following military training. Four days later, he developed psychiatric symptoms, including irrelevant answers, gibberish speech, irritability, and sleep disturbances. He denied any relevant medical, medication, epidemiological, or prodromal infection history, and further denied a history of tobacco and alcohol consumption. On admission, his body temperature was 37.5 °C, and his blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate were normal. Neurological examination revealed a weakened tendon reflex in the right upper extremity and a probable positive Kernig sign. No other abnormalities were observed. Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) nucleic acid test results were negative. Routine blood tests, liver and renal function, electrolytes, procalcitonin level, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and coagulation function were all within the normal ranges. Serum immunity indices revealed an increase in serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) at 32.2 g/L, whereas the remaining indices were normal, including immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin M (IgM), complement C3, complement C4, IgG4, antinuclear antibody spectrum, cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, myeloperoxidase, neutrophil proteinase 3, and rheumatoid factor. Tumour marker tests, including alpha-fetoprotein, carcinoma embryonic antigen, carcinoma antigen 125, carcinoma antigen 199, cytokeratin fragment 21-1, neuron-specific enolase, and prostate-specific antigen were within the normal ranges. Myocardial enzyme tests revealed an increased lactate dehydrogenase level of 5302 U/L, increased aspartate aminotransferase level of 843 U/L, increased creatine kinase level of 39,875 U/L, and increased myoglobin level of 684.6 ng/mL. A thyroid autoantibody test revealed an increase in thyroid globulin antibody of 98.92 IU/mL. The lymphocyte subset test revealed an increase in CD3‐/CD19+ (B cells) at 21.42% concurrent with a decrease in CD3‐/CD16+ 56 + Abs (js3/16 + 56) at 125.38 cells/μL. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure was normal. Routine and biochemistry CSF tests were within normal ranges. Tests for the Japanese encephalitis antibody, Cryptococcus neoformans capsular antigen, and microbial DNA sequencing in CSF all also showed no abnormalities. Oligoclonal bands, AE antibodies (NMDAR, AMPAR1, AMPAR2, LGI1, CASPR2, and CABABR), and demyelinating antibodies (AQP4, MBP, MOG, and GFAP) in the serum and CSF were all negative. The results of electrocardiogram, chest CT, abdominal ultrasound, urinary ultrasound, and echocardiography results were normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral thickening of the dura mater, particularly on the left side (Fig.  (A–D) In phase I, enhanced brain MRI revealed thickening of the bilateral dura mater, particularly on the left side. (E–H) In phase I, enhanced brain MRI revealed a slight improvement in the lesion of the dura mater during the process of immunotherapy. (I–L) In phase II, enhanced brain MRI revealed that thickening of dura mater was relieved after approximately 1 month of comprehensive treatment. The results of evaluation were as follows: the patient presented with limbic encephalitis characterized by psychiatric symptoms, sleep disturbances, and a low fever, indicating an inflammatory response. Suspicious positive signs of meningeal irritation and thickening of the dura mater suggested meningeal involvement. Accordingly, the patient was diagnosed with autoimmune meningoencephalitis, potentially induced by a viral infection. Following admission, the patient was treated with acyclovir, olanzapine, phenobarbital, and venous fluid replacement. After the diagnosis was clarified, impulsion therapy of IVIG (0.4 g/kg/d*5d) and methylprednisolone (1g/d*3d, 500 mg/d*2d, 250 mg/d*1d) were administered. Reexamination of the brain MRI in early November 2020 revealed a slight improvement in the lesion of the dura mater during immunotherapy (Fig.  Following discharge, the patient experienced a marked increase in fatigue, loss of emotions, and crying, accompanied by a low fever. The patient was subsequently readmitted to our hospital. The results of the COVID-19 nucleic acid test were still negative. Routine blood tests revealed an increase in white blood cell and neutrophil counts. Widal and Weil Felix tests revealed a positive Salmonella typhi O antibody titer of 1:160 and a positive Salmonella paratyphoid C antibody titer of 1:320. The serum galactomannan test revealed an increase in Aspergillus antigen at 0.61 (0.00–0.49) and the serum (1,3)-β-D-glucan test revealed an increase in fungal (1–3)-β-D-glucan at 210.4 pg/mL (<60 pg/mL). Quantitative determination of endotoxin levels and blood cultures revealed no significant abnormalities. The CSF pressure was normal. The CSF routine and biochemistry test, oligoclonal bands test, serum IgG4, serum and CSF AE antibodies (DPPX, IgLON5, GABAARα1, GABAARβ3, GlyRα1, mGluR5, D2R, Neurexin3α, GAD65), serum and CSF paraneoplastic syndrome antibodies (Hu, Yo, Ri, CV2, Ma2, Amphiphysin, Mal, SOX1, Tr/DNER, Zic4, GAD65, PKCγ, Recoverin, Titin), and CSF microbial RNA sequencing were all normal. Ultrasonography of the bilateral inguinal, neck, and axillary regions revealed bilateral cervical lymph node enlargement, indicating possible reactive hyperplasia, with no significant abnormal enlargement of the lymph nodes in the bilateral axilla and groin areas. Following lumbar puncture, the patient received IVIG (0.4 g/kg*5d) and methylprednisolone (60 mg/d). Considering the possibility of paratyphoid fever and fungal infection, levofloxacin and fluconazole were administered, while methylprednisolone was reduced to 30 mg/day for continued immune regulation treatment. In early December 2020, enhanced brain MRI revealed no bilateral thickening of the dura mater (Fig.  The patient again presented with a fever in late December 2022, with a maximum body temperature of 38 °C, and COVID-19 nucleic acid detection was positive. The patient ultimately developed sleep disorders 2 days later and psychiatric symptoms 6 days later. Physical examination revealed horizontal nystagmus to the left in both eyes with no other abnormalities. C-reactive protein and free thyroxine levels were slightly elevated. Serum cytokines tests further revealed an increase of interleukin (IL)-17 at 39.1 pg/mL (≤19 pg/mL). Routine and biochemical blood tests, Widal test, Weil–Felix test, and immunity indices (immunoglobulin A, IgG, IgM, complement C3, complement C4, IgG4, cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, antinuclear antibody spectrum, myeloperoxidase, neutrophil proteinase 3, and anti-glomerular basement antibody) showed no other abnormal findings. CSF pressure, routine CSF tests, biochemical tests, CSF cryptococcal capsular antigen levels, and oligoclonal bands were all normal. On December 27, 2022 testing for serum and CSF AE antibodies (NMDAR, AMPAR1, AMPAR2, LGI1, CASPR2, CABABR, DPPX, IgLON5, GABAARα1, GABAARβ3, GlyRα1, mGluR5, D2R, Neurexin3α, GAD65) and ganglioside antibodies (GM1, GM2, GM3, GM4, GD1a, GD1b, GD2, GD3, GT1a, GT1b, GQ1b, sulfatide) were planned. All tests for CSF antibodies were negative. Serum anti-GT1a antibody IgG and serum anti-CASPR2 antibody IgG were positive at a titer of 1:10 (Fig.  (A) The patient CSF immunofluorescence staining (TBA) at 4× magnification. (B) The patient CSF immunofluorescence staining (TBA) at 20× magnification showed vascular-like abnormal signal. (C) The patient CSF Caspr2 staining (CBA) was negative. (D) The patient serum Caspr2 staining (CBA) was positive at a dilution of 1:10. (A–D) In phase III, PET-CT of the brain revealed that the dura mater of the left frontal part was slightly thicker, metabolism was normal, and there were no obvious abnormalities in the brain parenchyma. (E–H) In phase III, the left dura mater was strengthened and thicker than the contralateral region in the enhanced brain MRI. (I–L) In phase III, the enhanced brain MRI showed that thickening of the dura mater was relieved after over 1 month of comprehensive treatment. PET-CT = positron emission tomography-computed tomography. The case summary was as follows: the patient had no manifestations of cranial nerve involvement or sensory disturbances, indicating that the anti-GT1a antibody was not responsible for the symptoms. Based on the above clinical manifestations, the positive serum CASPR2 antibodies, and thickening of the dura mater, the patient was diagnosed with CASPR2-related autoimmune encephalomeningitis. During his hospitalization, methylprednisolone (500 mg/d*3d) and IVIG (0.4 g/kg*5d) were administrated. Ganciclovir, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone were further administered for anti-infection therapy. In early January 2023, rituximab (640 mg) was intravenously administered. The patient’s symptoms substantially improved. Reexamination of serum and CSF anti-CASPR2 antibody IgG levels were negative. Following discharge, the patient continued to receive oral methylprednisolone (40 mg/day) as maintenance therapy. Repeat brain MRI scan in February (Fig.  In June 2023, the young man again presented with obsessive-compulsive symptoms, such as repacking clothes for a short time after a long journey. During hospitalization in July 2023, routine CSF, biochemical, cytokine, oligoclonal bands, anti-CASPR2 antibody, both in the serum and CSF, were reexamined, and brain MRI was performed. No apparent abnormalities were observed. The patient was treated with intravenous rituximab (600 mg) therapy in July 2023 (Fig.  The clinical course of our case. As mentioned above, in phase I, the patient manifested with low fever, limbic encephalitis, probable meningeal irritation signs, and thickened dura mater. Antiviral therapies and immunotherapies were effective at this stage. Although the results of pathogenic assays and autoimmunity-related antibodies were negative, viral infection-induced autoimmune meningoencephalitis was diagnosed. However, the patient presented with a low fever and limbic encephalitis in phase II. Laboratory tests indicated paratyphoid fever and fungal infection, whereas autoimmunity-related antibodies in both serum and CSF were negative. The patient was diagnosed with Salmonella infection-induced AE. Following anti-infective therapy and immunotherapy, his symptoms improved, the titers of the Widal and Weil Felix tests decreased, and no thickening of the dura mater was observed. In phase III, the patient was readmitted with fever, SARS-CoV-2 infection, limbic encephalitis, and thickening of the left dura mater. The serum anti-CASPR2 antibody IgG test results were positive. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with CASPR2-related autoimmune meningoencephalitis. Reviewing the 3 phases, similar clinical manifestations and imaging characteristics were observed. Although autoantibodies in the previous 2 phases were negative, the possibility of infection-related anti-CASPR2 meningoencephalitis remains highly suspected. These 3 episodes of encephalitis were mediated by possible viral, Salmonella, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. This case indicates the importance of paying attention to antibody-negative AE and monitoring antibodies repeatedly when necessary, as the results of antibodies may be negative in the early stages. The findings of previous studies have shown that the pathogenesis of AE may include disease triggers (infections), predisposing factors (human leukocyte antigen), and an interplay between these 2 factors. To date, no cases of AE induced by Salmonella or other enterobacteria have been reported. Noninfectious neurological complications of typhoid fever include encephalopathy, neuropsychiatric disorders, cerebral edema, cerebellar ataxia, Parkinsonism, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and brainstem encephalitis. Immune-mediated processes and endotoxaemia have been proposed as possible underlying mechanisms. It has been clearly shown that SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the respiratory system, causing mild to severe respiratory diseases. However, this virus also affects the nervous system, and can potentially exhibit neurotropic and neuroinvasive properties. CASPR2 is a cell adhesion molecule belonging to the neurexin IV superfamily. CASPR2 is encoded by the contactin-associated protein-like 2 gene on chromosome 7q35. CASPR2 is located in the limbic system, basal ganglia, neurones of other motor areas, and sensory pathways, and is particularly abundant in the temporal lobe. The most common MRI findings have been found to be T2 hyperintensities in the medial temporal lobe, followed by hippocampal atrophy, middle temporal gyrus sclerosis, and hippocampal sclerosis. The most common FDG-PET finding is hypometabolism in the temporal lobe. Based on the consensus regarding the diagnosis and treatment of AE, This is the first report of CASPR2 meningoencephalitis with thickened dura mater which was mediated by possible viral, Salmonella, and SARS-CoV-2 infection, reminding clinicians that the possibility of CASPR2 meningoencephalitis should also be considered when imaging only reveals thickening of the dura mater, also indicating the importance of paying attention to antibody-negative AE and monitoring antibodies repeatedly when necessary when the results of antibodies may be negative in the early stages. In addition to immunotherapy, one of the crucial measures for managing CASPR2-related AE or meningoencephalitis is the prevention of infections caused by viral, bacterial, and other rare pathogens. During immunosuppressive therapy to prevent disease recurrence and progression, some patients may develop opportunistic infections that can worsen their condition. We recommend comprehensive management throughout the disease process, dynamic monitoring of immune indicators such as IgG, IgM, and B lymphocytes, and advising patients to maintain a regular schedule and appropriate exercise, all of which may improve the disease.",

      "title": "Using Rasch analysis to assess the latent construct of the Capacity to Work Index in a Swedish working population sample",
      "content": "Measurements of capacity to work (CTW) in relation to common mental disorders (CMD) are needed to improve research on determinants for maintained work participation (WP). The aim of this study was to assess the construct validity of the Capacity to Work Index (C2WI) in a heterogenous sample of the Swedish working population. Cross-sectional web survey data among Swedish employees ( Common mental disorders (CMD) impact public health and work participation (WP) [ The generic Work Ability House model has four dimensions suggested to interact: health and functional capacities; competence; values, attitudes, motivation; and work, work community and management [ As a complementary CMD-specific approach, the Capacity to Work Index (C2WI) was developed to suit a working population and to contribute with details on how CTW varies. The C2WI was recently assessed in a field study [ The ‘Work Participation and Mental Health at Work’ project is part of the network ‘New Ways’—‘mental health at work’ aiming for scientific knowledge to promote WP and prevent sickness absence. This cross-sectional study utilized data from a web-based survey of employed individuals aged 18 years and older. There are no public registers of currently working employees in Sweden, so different recruitment procedures were used to obtain a large sample from heterogeneous work contexts. Initially, private sector employers and Swedish trade unions were contacted and provided with detailed information about the study. The recruitment of public sector employees was then conducted similarly. Employers who agreed to participate provided employees’ work emails. Study details, ethical considerations, and survey links were sent directly to the employees. Union members received the information from their union through newsletters via email. The initial data collection recruiting employees in the private sector yielded a limited number of participants ( Data were collected during 24 November 2021 and 18 August 2022. The first data collection was conducted by the SOM Institute, a non-profit academic web-survey centre within the University of Gothenburg. The second data collection, utilizing the web panel, was conducted by an external survey company (Enkätfabriken, Gothenburg, Sweden). The survey included questions on sociodemographic information, employment sector, work characteristics, and health-related instruments. Survey links remained open for 4 weeks. Two reminders were sent to employees recruited through employers, whereas no reminders were sent to employees recruited through unions. The present study included participants with complete responses on gender (those identifying as non-binary were excluded due to small numbers,  The C2WI consists of 17 statements ( The Swedish version of the World Health Organization—Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) was utilized. The WHO-5 is a unidimensional index measuring overall subjective well-being over a 2-week period on a six-point Likert scale ranging from ‘All of the time’ (coded 5) to ‘Never’ (coded 0). As suggested by Bech (2012) [ Age was coded into three categories: 18–34, 35–54, and 55–74 years. Level of education was coded into three categories: university/higher education, upper secondary, and compulsory school. Work sector was measured with three categories: public sector, private sector, and ‘others’. The category ‘others’ was deemed too small ( Data were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics Version: 29.0.0.0. Descriptive statistics are presented as frequencies and percentages. In the absence of established cut-off scores, the descriptive statistics for WHO-5 ( Sociodemographic characteristics of the study population The study population is not a simple random sample that might compromise representativity and generalizability. Dispersed numbers of participants are due to internal missing. Median = 46 years was used in the Rasch analysis (Q1 = 35, Q3 = 55). Descriptive statistics of the Capacity to Work Index (C2WI) in relation to CMD, based on the Swedish ‘Work participation and mental health at work’ (ADAPT) research project: 2021–2022, ( The Rasch analysis was performed using RUMM2030 software [ The overall fit to the RM was assessed by a χ We fitted the RM to two versions of the C2WI; the 17-item version as developed by Hensing et al. (2024) [ To determine if individuals with mental health problems were more prone to grasp the essence of the C2WI, a subgroup analysis was conducted. The subgroup consisted of participants who scored at or below the first quartile of the WHO-5 index (≤44), and by selecting the option ‘mental health problem’ when responding to the question: ‘Do you have a chronic illness, problem or disability’ ( The project received ethical approval by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Gothenburg (no. 783-106) and by The Swedish Ethical Review Authority (no. 2020-06031). The introductory letter informed employees that the study was independent of the employer, voluntary, and that they could withdraw at any time. It also provided details of their legal rights under the General Data Protection Regulation. As can be seen in  Overall model fit statistics for all random datasets and the total sample are presented in  Overall model fit of the C2WI, all samples, Andersen’s conditional likelihood (CLR) test, degrees of freedom (DF) Individual item fit was assessed using multiple sample sizes as indicators, and items showing misfit are summarized in  Items showing misfit according to various items fit statistics Bold indicates statistically significant misfit. The initial assessment of the 17-item scale indicated that the items did not discriminate as required, and the overall fit to the RM was poor. As a next step, the Rasch analysis was performed on the seven-item scale. The results for the overall model fit and the item fit indicators are summarized in  A subgroup analysis was done by testing the seven-item scale among participants reporting low mental well-being in random samples of varying sizes ( The objective of this study was to determine the construct validity of the C2WI using the RM. In particular, the study sought to ascertain the unidimensionality of the instrument, the appropriateness of the response categories, and the presence of DIF with regard to gender and age. The 17-item scale did not reach predetermined levels of fit in any of the analyses. The seven-item scale indicated unidimensionality; yet, the overall fit to the RM remained deficient, and multiple indicators on the item level showed a lack of fit. The result for the subgroup reporting low mental well-being showed a better fit to the RM, with fewer items exhibiting disordered thresholds and better targeting compared to the corresponding analysis in previous tests. However, this was not sufficient to distinguish between response categories. The result indicates multidimensionality, which is consistent with the theoretical understanding of CTW as a phenomenon that occurs in a dynamic interaction between the individual and the work context. CTW is a multifaceted construct that encompasses a range of elements, including knowledge, skills, abilities and motivation. These elements are shaped by the specific social settings in which they are practised. CTW is best understood as a continuum, from excellent to very poor; thus, the latent construct is not absolute; rather, it is relative to the context in which human performance occurs. The C2WI was developed to advance the understanding of how CTW is reduced. The WAI contains open-ended questions such as ‘current work ability compared with the lifetime best’ and ‘work ability in relation to the demands of the job’. Such questions reflect ‘that’ the work ability is reduced, and to what extent, but they do not really provide information about ‘how’. The C2WI was developed in a multiple step process [ In future studies comparing C2WI with other instruments measuring relevant aspects for WP, such as competence and work-related self-efficacy, could give complementary information to the construct validity, such as content validity and possible correlations between the different constructs. While the C2WI did not meet the Rasch criteria for construct validity, it may nonetheless reflect a satisfactory content validity and prove useful in predicting WP. The study population represents different sectors, occupations, gender, age groups and varies in several other ways. We consider this, as well as the large sample size, a strength, as multiple experiences and work contexts contribute to the analysis. The sample size may have been unnecessary large, but since data were not collected for the Rasch analysis only, we decided to use the full sample. Danielsson et al. (2020) [ In our study, we used multiple techniques to overcome the risk with χ Both the full version and a short version of the instrument were validated. It has been suggested in the literature that determining which items to include in an instrument should be guided by considerations other than just psychometric properties [ Available softwares for doing Rasch analyses have pros and cons. We used the RUMM2030 in which, as mentioned earlier, the global test of model fit is sensitive to larger sample sizes. Measures described in the previous paragraph contributed to overcome some of these problems. CTW in relation to CMD assessed by the C2WI did not meet the criteria for construct validity as outlined by the RM. The findings can serve to reinforce the understanding of the CTW-construct as multidimensional. Real-world experiences of CTW are multifaceted and reflect expressions of mental health in a variety of work settings. The results were discouraging but the attempt is justified given the lack of instruments determining CTW as a factor that may maintain WP in relation to CMD in a working population. When C2WI was assessed in a subgroup comprising participants with low mental well-being, the instrument demonstrated a stronger tendency towards attaining the predetermined level of fit to the RM.",

      "content": "Renal dysfunction is highly prevalent among patients with pulmonary embolism (PE). This study combined population-based study and Mendelian randomization (MR) to observe the relationship between renal function and PE. A nested case–control study were performed using data of PE patients and controls were from two nationwide cohorts, the China pUlmonary thromboembolism REgistry Study (CURES) and China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey (CHARLS). Baseline characteristics were balanced using propensity score matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting. Restricted cubic spline models were applied for the relationship between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline and the risk of PE. Bidirectional two-sample MR analyses were performed using genome-wide association study summary statistics for eGFR involving 1,201,909 individuals and for PE from the FinnGen consortium. \nThe nested case–control study including 17,547 participants (6,322 PE patients) found that eGFR distribution was significantly different between PE patients and controls (\n Our findings support the hypothesis that renal function decline contributes to an elevated PE risk. Together with the high prevalence of chronic kidney diseases globally, there arises the necessity for monitoring and modulation of renal function in effective PE prevention. \nAcute pulmonary embolism (PE) refers to a condition in which the pulmonary artery or its branches are obstructed by a thrombus that originated from the deep veins of the pelvis and legs. Together with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), they are commonly known as venous thromboembolism (VTE). With an annual incidence of 39 to 115/100,000 population, PE is the third most prevalent cardiovascular disease worldwide, after ischemic heart disease and stroke and is one of the leading causes of cardiovascular death.\n \nThe prevalence of renal insufficiency was reported to be high among PE patients in several large PE registries, ranging between 27 and 49%.\n \nMendelian randomization (MR) is an important approach to estimating the causal relationship between exposure and outcome, employing genetic variants associated with specific exposure as instruments to compare two genetically defined groups with different average levels of exposure (glossary seen in the\n \nSince these genetic variants are generally not linked to confounders, any differences in the outcome between individuals who carry the variant and those who do not can be attributed to variations in the associated risk factor (detailed description of several statistical methods seen in the\n In this study, we first conducted a nested case–control study from two nationwide cohorts to characterize the observational association between renal function (measured by creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) and PE, followed by bidirectional MR analyses to estimate the causal relationship between them. \nAssociation between eGFR values and PE risk.

The individual propensity to the presence of PE was estimated using a logistic regression model incorporating confounding variables as covariates, including variables that were significantly different between groups in univariable analyses and were known to be associated with renal function. Then, 1:1 PSM was performed between two groups, followed by IPTW performed as previously described.\n \nTransethnic genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for eGFR were obtained from the largest meta-analysis on eGFR to date, which pooled data of the Chronic Kidney Disease Genetics Consortium (CKDGen, encompassing European [\n \nWe further obtained the PE summary statistics from the FinnGen consortium (\n \nMR uses genetic variants, mainly SNPs, as IVs to explore the genetic link between an exposure and an outcome.

Baseline characteristics were significantly different between these two groups in terms of demographic variables and comorbidities. PE groups were older, with higher BMI, more likely to comorbid cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, chronic pulmonary diseases, and kidney diseases, (\n Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index; CHARLS, China Health and Retirement longitudinal Survey; CURES, China Pulmonary Thromboembolism Registry Study; CVD, cardiovascular diseases; DM, diabetes mellitus; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; IPTW, inverse probability of treatment weighting; PSM, propensity score matching; SMD, standardized mean differences.

Here, none of the methods (IVW, MR-Egger, MR-PRESSO, weighted median) showed significant results, suggesting no evidence that PE could affect creatinine-based eGFR (OR = 1·00, 95% CI: 0.99–1·00,\n Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; IV, instrumental variable; MR, Mendelian randomization; OR, odds ratio; PE, pulmonary embolism. Note: The table illustrated the odd ratios and 95% CI calculated by inverse variance weighted, maximum likelihood, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO methods, using primary and supplementary instrumental variables, when PE was the exposure and eGFR decline was the outcome. In this study, we provided the evidence that renal function decline was probably causally associated with PE. The nested case–control study based on two large-scale cohorts suggested that low eGFR was associated with PE prevalence, followed by MR analyses using the largest eGFR GWAS to date, confirmed that genetically predicted eGFR decline was associated with the development of PE. This is the first study combining large-scale observational analyses and MR that reveals the association between declined renal function and the occurrence of PE. \nPreviously, studies have demonstrated high incidence of VTE in CKD or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) populations confirmed by MR analysis.\n \nThe mechanism under the relationship between renal insufficiency and PE contain several pathways: nephrotic syndrome is the most recognized condition of high risk of VTE, with clear mechanisms of the urinary loss of antithrombin and higher level of platelet activation. Moreover, studies showed endogenous anticoagulants such as antithrombin were lower than general population in patients with nephrotic syndrome. However, inconsistent results were reported by another study using renal impaired population caused by various reasons, suggesting that loss of antithrombin might only exist in patients with damaged glomerular filtration barriers.\n \nWe innovatively quantify the decrease of eGFR that lower than 88 mL/min per 1.73 m\n \nThe primary strength of the current study is combining the nested case–control study and MR study with large population, which minimized bias from confounding and reverse causality. Moreover, unlike previous studies focusing on VTE, the research for the first time uncovered the potential causal relationship between renal function and PE. Furthermore, the MR analyses employed genetic instruments of eGFR from the most recent and largest GWAS studies, and findings were reinforced by the consistent results observed using two independent sets of IVs and several analytical approaches for MR estimates. However, several limitations of the current study are necessary to be discussed. First, a major limitation of the MR design is horizontal pleiotropy. However, in this study, biases induced by pleiotropic effects are likely minimal. There was no indications of horizontal pleiotropy in the MR-Egger test and consistent results were drawn from several sensitivity analyses. Second, the results of the nested case–control study could be potentially biased since cases and controls came from two cohorts employing different technical specifications. Nevertheless, both cohorts employed the same and standardized test for serum creatinine (\n \nThis study provided compelling evidence from a large population supporting eGFR decline is an independent risk factor for PE, and the risk of PE significantly increased when kidney function declines to the threshold right below the normal level (88 mL/min per 1.73 m",

For male pattern hair loss, minoxidil and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (e.g. finasteride, dutasteride) can be used. Combination therapy is commonly employed, with clinical improvement typically requiring a minimum of 6 months. Supplements and other treatments have varying levels of evidence, and counselling is important to help patients make informed decisions about their management. Hair is deeply intertwined with a person’s identity. Hair loss therefore can have a profound psychological impact and induce feelings of low self-worth, lack of physical attractiveness and fear of social rejection. In brief, the hair cycle consists of 3 main phases: anagen (growth), catagen (transitional) and telogen (resting), with hair follicles cycling between these stages to produce and shed hair over time. In AGA, alterations in the hair cycle include shortening of anagen and lengthening of telogen, resulting in reduced hair growth. There are 2 forms of alopecia: scarring (where the follicles are permanently lost) and non-scarring. AGA is a non-scarring alopecia. As the follicular unit is preserved, AGA is considered at least partially reversible. The prevalence of AGA increases with age. Male pattern hair loss is thought to affect 80% of males by the age of 80. Both males and females with AGA report hair thinning. Female patients may report progressive hair shedding and loss of ponytail volume, and male patients may report hairline recession. A positive family history or a history of thyroid dysfunction may be present. There may also be an association with polycystic ovary syndrome. The causes of hair loss are diverse and varied, although the distribution of hair loss observed can provide clues about potential triggers. Severe psychological stress, systemic illness, endocrinological abnormalities, nutritional deficiencies, infections and malignancy can all contribute to hair loss, and a detailed history and thorough clinical examination can help differentiate potential causes. On examination, in female pattern hair loss, there is diffuse hair thinning with the temporal and occipital scalp usually preserved. Widening of the central part with frontal accentuation (i.e. Christmas tree pattern) may be noted. In male pattern hair loss, there is usually bitemporal hairline recession with or without scalp vertex hair loss. Commonly used classification scales include the Norwood–Hamilton scale for male pattern hair loss, and the Ludwig scale and Sinclair scale for female pattern hair loss. The hair pull test and dermoscopy of the scalp (also known as trichoscopy) can assist in the clinical diagnosis of AGA. The hair pull test involves holding approximately 60 hairs between the index finger and thumb and pulling these hairs away from the vertex, parietal and occipital areas of the scalp. A positive hair pull test is defined when more than 2 hairs are removed from the scalp. Trichoscopy of AGA demonstrates miniaturised hairs, with a reduction of hairs per follicular unit; the follicular openings (ostia) are preserved. Scalp biopsies are not routinely performed; however, they may be used if there is diagnostic uncertainty. There are multiple differentials for AGA. For example, telogen effluvium presents as abrupt hair loss following pregnancy or a severe psychological or physical stressor. The hair pull test is positive and empty follicles may be seen on trichoscopy. Alopecia areata presents as well-circumscribed patches of hair loss in adults or children; trichoscopy may reveal black dots and exclamation mark hairs. AGA can present simultaneously with other forms of hair loss, such as telogen effluvium. Referral to resources such as DermNet for photographs can aid in the diagnosis. Symptoms such as scalp pain, itch or burning, extensive hair loss, or rapid hair loss in the absence of a preceding trigger, warrant urgent escalation of care to a dermatologist. It is important that the primary care physician is able to identify scarring alopecias to allow early referral to a dermatologist for treatment, as these can lead to permanent hair loss. If hormonal abnormalities are suspected that cannot be managed in the primary care setting, general practitioners (GPs) may consider the involvement of an endocrinologist to optimise patient management. As hair loss affects a person’s physical appearance, it is important that patients are counselled appropriately about treatment expectations, including the risks and benefits of treatments, so that they can make informed decisions about their management. In most cases, treatments are not curative and are designed to slow progression of hair loss and stimulate hair growth. Concurrent conditions such as tinea capitis or seborrhoeic dermatitis must be addressed, and nutritional deficiencies such as iron deficiency, or metabolic disorders such as thyroid dysfunction, must be treated prior to starting treatment for hair loss. Most pharmacological treatments take at least 6 months to show a response and may need to be continued long term. Referral to dermatologists may then be considered if there is no response to treatment after 6 months. Serial photography can assist with monitoring response to treatment. Nonpharmacological management should be encouraged, and this includes the use of healthy hair care practices, creative hair styling and the use of cosmetic camouflage (e.g. natural keratin fibres). Pharmacological treatments may stimulate hair growth and/or prevent further hair loss ( NB1: Dutasteride is approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (Australia) for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Combination therapy (e.g. with antiandrogens) is more effective than monotherapy at minimising hair loss and may be considered for those with moderate to severe AGA. In female pattern hair loss, antiandrogen therapy may be considered particularly in those with signs of hyperandrogenism (e.g. hirsutism, acne). For  topical minoxidil (2 to 5%) with oral spironolactone 25 to 50 mg oral minoxidil (compounded into 0.25 mg tablets) with oral spironolactone 25 to 50 mg sublingual or oral minoxidil 0.25 to 1 mg with oral spironolactone 25 to 50 mg and oral finasteride 1 mg in postmenopausal women. Co-prescription of contraception with spironolactone is strongly encouraged (see  5-alpha-reductase inhibitors can be used off label in postmenopausal women; however, evidence for its use is limited. This treatment is generally not recommended in premenopausal women due to the risk of feminisation of the male fetus. For  topical minoxidil 5% with oral finasteride 0.5 to 1 mg sublingual or oral minoxidil (compounded into 2.5 to 5 mg tablets) with oral finasteride 1 mg. Topical finasteride (0.1 to 0.25% solution or lotion, used once or twice daily) is being investigated as a treatment for AGA. In a phase 3 randomised controlled trial, the efficacy of topical finasteride 0.25% spray was compared with oral finasteride 1 mg as well as placebo. Although there was a significant improvement in target area hair count with topical finasteride compared with placebo, no difference in hair diameter was noted. Generally, treatment is continued according to patient preference and tolerance of medications. Stopping treatment leads to progression of AGA. Nutritional supplements such as zinc, vitamins B and D, and antioxidants have been used extensively for hair loss; however, evidence for their efficacy is highly variable. It is essential that clinicians appropriately counsel patients as the benefits of nutritional interventions are unknown, their use may be expensive and lead to toxic effects at high doses, and they can interact with medications and test results, particularly biotin. There are several other treatment options that all have limited evidence. Mesotherapy involves the intradermal injection of therapeutic agents and bioactive substances. The use of platelet-rich plasma has been proposed for many dermatological disorders given its anti-inflammatory and regenerative properties through angiogenesis, cell differentiation and proliferation. Low-level laser therapy devices emit low-power coherent monochromatic red light that has been shown to promote hair growth as a result of increased blood flow to the hair follicle. Patients in whom medical therapy has failed may consider surgical management, which involves hair transplantation and results in permanent hair restoration. Treatment of AGA involves a multipronged approach, where medical treatments are personalised to the patient, considering goals, cost and comorbidities. Referral to a dermatologist should be considered if the diagnosis is unclear, scarring alopecia is suspected, patients do not respond after 6 months of active pharmacological treatment, there is psychological distress due to hair loss, or if there are concomitant symptoms such as pain or discomfort. Patients should be counselled from the outset about the array of treatment options for AGA, and patient expectations should be guided with regard to response to treatments.",

      "title": "Nanoparticle encapsulation enables systemic IGF-Trap delivery to inhibit intracerebral glioma growth",
      "content": "Glioblastoma is an aggressive brain cancer with a 5-year survival rate of 5–10%. Current therapeutic options are limited, due in part to drug exclusion by the blood–brain barrier, restricting access of targeted drugs to the tumor. The receptor for the type 1 insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1R) was identified as a therapeutic target in glioblastoma. We previously reported that the intracerebral growth of glioma cells with reduced IGF-1R levels was inhibited. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the sensitivity of glioma cells to a novel IGF-axis inhibitor, the IGF-Trap, and optimize its delivery to the brain. We tested the effect of the IGF-Trap on the growth of the human glioma stem cells MES-1123 and U87 MG cells, and of murine GL261 cells in vivo, using subcutaneous and orthotopic implantation. We show that the growth of glioma cells implanted subcutaneously or orthotopically in the brain was inhibited by systemic and direct intracerebral administration of IGF-Trap, respectively, resulting in increased survival. To increase the efficiency of systemic delivery to the brain, we encapsulated the IGF-Trap in trimethyl chitosan (TRIOZAN™) nanoparticles prior to intravenous injection. We found that nanoparticle encapsulation increased the uptake and retention of the IGF-Trap in the brain and resulted in an improved therapeutic effect against intra-cerebrally growing tumors. Our results identify the IGF-Trap as a potent inhibitor of intracerebral glioma growth and show that encapsulation in nanoparticles can improve delivery of biologics such as the IGF-Trap to the brain, thereby enhancing the therapeutic response. Glioma cells growing in the brain were sensitive to treatment with the IGF-Trap. Encapsulation in TRIOZAN nanoparticles increased brain levels of systemically administered IGF-Trap, inhibited glioma growth, and increased survival. The clinical management of glioma has been hampered by limited access of targeted biologics to the tumor site, due to exclusion by the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Effective treatment of glioma, therefore, faces the double challenge of identifying drugs that target specific drivers of glioma growth in vivo and successfully delivering those inhibitors to the tumor site to curtail its growth. In the present study, we aimed to address both of these challenges. Our results identify blockade of the IGF-axis as an effective therapeutic strategy to inhibit intracerebral glioma growth. They also show that encapsulation of this biologic in TRIOZAN, a trimethyl chitosan-based nanoparticle, increased the efficiency of its systemic delivery to the brain and enhanced its therapeutic effect in an orthotopic murine glioma model. These results have translational implications for the treatment of glioma but may also be more broadly relevant for the management of other brain tumors, including brain metastases from other primary malignancies. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most prevalent primary brain tumor in adults. Glioblastoma occurs at higher rates in persons older than 55 years of age and the 5-year survival rate for GBM patients is a dismal 5–10%. The ligands, insulin-like growth factors (IGF-1 and IGF-2) are involved in cell growth and differentiation. Ligand binding triggers IGF-1R signaling via the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways and nuclear IGF-1R transport to activate gene transcription, thereby regulating resistance to apoptosis, cell proliferation, and cell cycle progression and promoting tumor growth. We previously reported on the bioengineering of a potent IGF-1R signaling inhibitor, the IGF-Trap—a fusion protein consisting of the entire extracellular domain of the human IGF-1R fused to the Fc domain of human IgG One major challenge to successful treatment of GBM and other brain malignancies is effective drug delivery to the brain, as drug exclusion by the blood–brain barrier (BBB) limits drug access to the tumor. The BBB is a semi-permeable layer of specialized endothelial cells as well as astrocytic end-feet processes and basement membrane that protect the brain from foreign and potentially harmful substances. Human U87MG and mouse GL261 glioma cells were obtained from the ATCC and the DTP/DCTD/NCI Tumor Repository, respectively. The use of these cells as GBM models has been extensively reviewed elsewhere. All mouse experiments were carried out in strict accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC) “Guide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals” and under the conditions and procedures approved by the Animal Care Committee of McGill University (AUP number: 5733). All mice were bred in the animal facility of the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Center and used for the experiments at the ages of 7–12 weeks old. The experiments were performed in male (or as indicated) NSG mice (for U87 MG, MES-1123, and orthotopic GL261 injections) or in syngeneic C57Bl/6 mice (for subcutaneous GL261 injections). The IGF-Trap is a fusion protein consisting of the entire extracellular domain of the human IGF-1R fused to the Fc portion of human IgG Glioma cells were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in full medium. The medium was then replaced with FBS-free medium containing, or not, 10 ng/ml of IGF-1 and in the presence or absence of IGF-Trap, at the indicated molar ratios to IGF-1. The cells were incubated for up to 96 hours and the increase in cell numbers was analyzed every 24 h by quantifying formazan crystals reduced by the NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductase enzyme—an indicator of metabolic activity. Absorbance at 570nm was measured using the Infinite 200 PRO microplate reader (TECAN Switzerland, Morrisville, NC, USA). Cell cycle progression was analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells in 6-well plates (5 × 10 U87MG or GL261 cells (1 × 10 U87MG (2 × 10 TRIOZAN™ nanoparticles (commercialized by Ovensa Inc.) were formed as an ionic complex between the polysaccharides trimethylamine chitosan (TRIOZAN™, Mw > 50 kDa, degree of quaternization > 50%) - a cationic biopolymer and sodium dextran sulfate (DS) - an anionic biopolymer, mixed with the ionic gelation agent tripolyphosphate (TPP) at a fixed TRIOZAN:DS:TPP ratio. A microfluidic chip with controlled flow rates (Precision NanoSystems, Vancouver, BC, Canada) was used to improve reproducibility between preparations. In this complex, TRIOZAN™ is added in excess to the negatively charged polymers, to retain a positive overall surface charge. The zeta-potential of the nanoparticles was measured and was equal to +14.4 ±0.7 mV in PBS pH 7.4, consistent with a surface composition of trimethyl chitosan. Nanoparticle encapsulation of the IGF-Trap was achieved by precipitating the two polyelectrolytes to form complexes (PEC) in the presence of IGF-Trap. Excess, non-encapsulated IGF-Trap was removed by centrifugation (30 min at 42,000 To enable detection of the IGF-Trap in vivo, it was conjugated to a near-infrared fluorescent dye (CF680R-succinimide) using an average of 2 dye molecules/IGF-Trap (λex 680 nm/λem 701 nm), as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Biotium, Fremont CA, USA). The CF™680R succinimide ester (NHS-CF™680) was covalently bound to primary amines of IGF-Trap. The mixture of the IGF-Trap with the CF™ dye was agitated for 1h at room temperature, pH 8.0, and the fluorescently labeled IGF-Trap was purified from excess free CF™680R using an Amicon centrifugal filter Eppendorf tube with a 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff, and rinsed 4 times with fresh PBS. The labeled protein was detectable by confocal microscopy performed on frozen sections and by optical imaging in live animals using the IVIS Spectrum/200. NSG mice were injected with IGF-Trap that was pre-labeled with a fluorescent tag (CF680R (λex 680nm/λem 701 nm) and NP-encapsulated, or not (free IGF-Trap). The animals were sacrificed and the brains removed, 1–12 hr post injection and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, followed by a 3 day incubation in a 30% sucrose solution. The brains were then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and cryostat sections of 10 μm thickness were prepared. The sections were immunostained with a rat anti-mouse CD31 antibody (BD Biosciences, cat# 550,274) followed by an AF488-conjugated anti-rat IgG secondary antibody (λex 490 nm/λem 525 nm, Invitrogen) to visualize blood vessels, counterstained with DAPI and mounted in the ProLong Gold mounting reagent. Fluorescent images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM780 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with an AxioCam camera, and analyzed by ImageJ. Male NSG mice were randomized into 3 treatment groups for injection i.v. with NP-Trap, free IGF-Trap (5 mg/kg), or vehicle (PBS). Treatment began 3 and 1 days prior to intracranial injection of 10 Cells (as indicated) were lysed using the RIPA buffer (50mM Tris (pH 7.4), 1mM EDTA, 150mM NaCl, 1% (w/v) NP-40, 2mM Na Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6. The one-way ANOVA (post-hoc test) was used to analyze results of in vitro MTT assays, the student’s t test to analyze tumor measurements and the Gehan-Brewslow-Wilcoxon test to analyze Kaplan Meier survival curves. We began by evaluating the effect of the IGF-Trap on glioma growth in vitro. GL261 and U87 MG cells were selected for this study because they are highly aggressive in vivo and recapitulate GBM phenotypes and drug responses. The IGF-Trap inhibits IGF-1 induced glioma growth in vitro. U87MG (A) and GL261 (B) cells were cultured in low (1%) FBS medium supplemented on day 0 with 10 ng/ml IGF-1 and with and without IGF-Trap that was added at 1:1 or 1:2 (IGF-1: IGF-Trap) molar ratio. Cell Proliferation was measured using the MTT assay. Results are expressed as means (± SD) fold change in OD (570 nm) relative to time 0 ( To evaluate the therapeutic effect of IGF-Trap in vivo, we began with a subcutaneous (s.c.) tumor model where tumor growth can be more directly measured. Syngeneic C57Bl/6 and NSG male mice were inoculated s.c. with 10 The IGF-Trap inhibits the growth of subcutaneously injected glioma cells. GL261 cells (B and C) and U87MG (D and E) cells (10 Having established the sensitivity of the tumor cells to IGF-Trap treatment in vitro and in vivo, we next sought to determine whether their growth in the brain could also be blocked by the IGF-Trap. To overcome the likely exclusion of circulating IGF-Trap from the brain by the BBB, we administered the IGF-Trap directly into the brain via a cannula implanted intracerebrally. GL261 cells expressing the luciferase gene were injected orthotopically into the brain (10 IGF-Trap administered intra-cerebrally inhibits the growth of orthotopically implanted glioma cells. Luciferase tagged GL261 (10 We confirmed the inhibitory effect of IGF-Trap using GBM stem cell (GSC) xenografts growing in NSG mice. Mice were injected orthotopically with the very aggressive human glioma stem cells (GSC) MES-1123 and treated as described above. Untreated mice implanted intra-cranially with 2.5 × 10 The IGF-Trap also inhibits the growth of orthotopically implanted human glioma stem cell xenografts. NSG mice were implanted intra-cerebrally with 2.5 × 10 Continuous drug administration via a cerebrally implanted cannula, while it may be effective in delivering the drug to the tumor site, is challenging in the clinical setting. Optimally, drugs should access the brain from the circulation in high enough concentrations to affect local tumor growth. However, access to large biologics such as antibodies and the IGF-Trap is hindered by the BBB. Strategies to increase penetrability of biologics into the brain for the treatment of malignant disease are therefore actively being sought. We selected to use a nanoparticle (NP)-based delivery approach for increased IGF-Trap delivery and retention in the brain. Nanocarriers have the added advantage of decreasing drug uptake and opsonization by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS). TRIOZAN™, is a polymeric nanocarrier that enables the encapsulation and protection of targeted drugs (small molecules and biologics) and was shown to improve drug delivery across the BBB. IGF-Trap encapsulation in trimethyl chitosan nanoparticles increases the uptake, stability and intra-vascular levels of the IGF-Trap in the brain. IGF-Trap was labeled with the CF680 dye and encapsulated in TRIOZAN™ nanoparticles (NP-Trap). NP-Trap and the free IGF-Trap were injected intravenously, and the biodistribution was monitored over 24 h using optical imaging. Shown in (A) are images of the injected mice acquired at the indicated time intervals and in (B) mean fluorescent signal intensity (±SD) calculated as an output of the fluorescent intensity of the selected region of interest (brain) normalized to a non-injected control mouse and taking into account the background fluorescent signal of each image. Data are expressed as fold change relative to the mean signal detected at 0.083 hr that was assigned a value of 1. In a separate experiment (C), the mice were injected i.v. with 5 mg/kg fluorescently tagged IGF-Trap encapsulated, or not in TRIOZAN™, brains removed at the indicated time intervals, cryostat sections prepared, immunostained with anti-CD31 antibodies and counter stained with DAPI. Shown (C-left) are representative confocal images acquired at the indicated time intervals post IGF-Trap injection. IGF-Trap localized within CD31 To determine the location of the IGF-Trap in the brain, the brains were removed 1 and 4 hr postinjection of NP-encapsulated or free IGF-Trap, cryostat sections were prepared, stained with an antibody to CD31 to identify vascular structures and analyzed using confocal microscopy. Within 1 hr of the injection, fluorescently labeled IGF-Trap could be observed within, or in proximity to brain blood vessels, in both treatment groups ( Finally, having documented a more prolonged retention of NP-encapsulated IGF-Trap in the brain and localization within, and adjacent to vascular structures, we assessed the effect of the encapsulated IGF-Trap on intracerebral tumor growth. Mice were injected intracerebrally with GL261 cells and treated with encapsulated or free IGF-Trap, using the regimen outlined in  Nanoparticle-encapsulated IGF-Trap administered systemically inhibits intracerebral tumor growth and extends animal survival. Male NSG mice were divided into 3 treatment groups that were injected i.v. with free IGF-Trap, NP-Trap each at a dose calculated to deliver 5 mg/kg, or vehicle (PBS) using the regimen shown in (A). They were then injected intra-cerebrally with 10 Drug delivery to the brain remains a major challenge due to the limited diffusion through the BBB and strategies are therefore being sought for transiently breaching the BBB to increase drug access to the brain for the treatment of primary and metastatic tumors. Here we show that the intracerebral growth of aggressive human gliomas and patient-derived glioma stem cells could be inhibited by the direct intracranial administration of the IGF-Trap, consistent with the documented role of the IGF- axis in glioma progression. Of note are our results with MES-1123—the highly aggressive patient-derived glioma stem cells. We found a modest (but significant) increase in the survival of mice injected orthotopically with these cells, when treated with the IGF-Trap. In view of their rapid growth, whereby all control mice were at humane end point by 12 days post injection, our results suggest that targeting the IGF-axis may be clinically beneficial, particularly if enough of the drug can reach the tumor site. Similar results were reported by Zamykal et al, using mice that were orthotopically implanted with U87 cells and treated with the IGF-1R targeting antibody IMC-A12 delivered to the tumor site via an intra-cerebrally implanted catheter. Continuous direct intracranial drug delivery is clinically challenging. We therefore sought to use a non-invasive method to optimize the potential clinical utility of the IGF-Trap for GBM treatment. Nanomedicine has emerged as an important platform for increasing drug delivery and efficacy for cancer treatment. In contrast to other studies where the levels of N-trimethyl chitosan-encapsulated agents in the brain were evaluated postmortem, We observed that the injection of free IGF-Trap intravenously also reduced the intracerebral growth of the GL261 tumors, although the effect did not reach statistical significance when compared to vehicle-treated mice. This, more modest, effect may be due to the reduction in the bioavailability of circulating IGF-1 and IGF-2 that can cross the BBB due to their small size (7–7.5 kD) In this study, when administering IGF-Trap systemically (as free IGF-Trap or NP-encapsulated), we pretreated the mice prior to intracerebral tumor cell injection in order to reduce the bioavailability of locally produced ligands in the brain. We therefore cannot rule out the possibility that IGF-Trap in this setting, also affected initial tumor cell engraftment in the brain. Although this treatment regimen is obviously impracticable in the clinical setting for the management of primary GBM, it may have utility in prevention of tumor recurrence. Furthermore, in this study, we used IGF-Trap as a monotherapy. In the clinical setting, given the aggressive nature of this disease, IGF-Trap is likely to be most effective when combined with other modalities such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. In those settings, when tumor volume is reduced and its outgrowth is inhibited by additional treatment regimens, pretreatment with IGF-Trap or long-term sustained treatment may not be required to achieve optimal disease management. Other studies have also documented increased drug delivery and potency when the target agents were encapsulated in trimethyl chitosan-based formulations. For example, trimethyl chitosan-encapsulated retinoic acid was used to treat glioblastoma cells in vitro and this resulted in increased cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and necrosis. Finally, our findings may have clinical implications beyond the treatment of GBM, as nanomedicine may enable delivery of targeted drugs to the brain for the treatment of metastases from other malignancies such as breast carcinoma and melanoma, where antibodies and other drugs with known therapeutic efficacy against the primary tumor and non-cerebral metastases are already in routine use in the clinic.

      "title": "Development and validation of a molecular classifier of meningiomas",
      "content": "Meningiomas exhibit considerable clinical and biological heterogeneity. We previously identified 4 distinct molecular groups ( Using an international cohort of 1698 meningiomas, we constructed and rigorously validated a machine learning-based molecular classifier using only DNA methylation data as input. Original and newly predicted molecular groups were compared using DNA methylation, RNA sequencing, copy number profiles, whole-exome sequencing, and clinical outcomes. We show that group-specific outcomes in the validation cohort are nearly identical to those originally described, with median progression-free survival (PFS) of 7.4 (4.9–Inf) years in  Our DNA methylation-based classifier, which is publicly available for immediate clinical use, recapitulates the biology and outcomes of the original molecular groups as assessed using multiple metrics/platforms that were not used in its training. We develop a methylation-based tool to prospectively classify meningiomas into molecular groups. Predicted groups strongly recapitulate expected clinical and biological profiles. This will allow increasingly personalized care for patients with meningioma. We previously showed that molecular groups of meningioma, identified by combining multiple genomic approaches, can successfully resolve much of the disease heterogeneity that has limited translational progress in this disease to date. However, their discovery using high-dimensional clustering approaches and multi-omics data does not lend itself readily to classifying prospective cases in the clinical setting. Here we present a point-and-click tool to classify prospective meningioma cases into their respective molecular group using DNA methylation alone. Using multiple orthogonal data types including DNA methylation, RNA sequencing, exome sequencing, and clinical outcomes, we show that our model faithfully recapitulates the molecular groups that were originally described using a large, multi-institutional cohort of 1698 cases. This novel tool can be readily integrated into existing DNA methylation-based workflows to increase personalization of patient care and form the basis of molecularly-informed clinical trials for meningioma. We make this tool publicly available. Meningioma, the most common primary intracranial tumor, We previously described 4 consensus molecular groups of meningioma by integrating DNA methylation, transcriptomic, and copy number alterations (CNAs) derived from whole-exome sequencing data To address this critical gap and translate the biologic insights of these novel molecular groups into clinical practice, we focused on adapting a multiplatform description of molecular classification into a more convenient single platform approach by building a classifier that predicts meningioma molecular group classification using only raw DNA methylation files as input. We used DNA methylation to anchor this classifier since CNAs can be inferred from these data, and because methylation-based classifiers have gained considerable traction in the clinical care of brain tumor patients. The cohort for this study was generated by using a combination of previously published cases analyzed by our group, datasets made publicly available, and additional cases we obtained for this new analysis. Our total study cohort was divided into a discovery cohort and a validation cohort. The discovery cohort included a previously published cohort used to describe the original 4 molecular groups. Sample acquisition and processing have been described in detail previously. Between 250 and 500 ng of extracted DNA was bisulfite converted using the EZ DNA Methylation Kit followed by methylation profiling using the Illumina 850k EPIC array. Raw output (.idat files) were imported, preprocessed, and ssNoob normalized using the  We inferred chromosome arm-level gains and losses using the  Extracted RNA was paired-end sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 to target 70 million reads per sample. Output fastq files were aligned to the GRCh38 human reference genome using the STAR aligner. All samples in the discovery cohort, as well as prospective samples from the prospective RTOG-0539 clinical trial, underwent whole-exome sequencing. Mutational data from a publicly available cohort In addition, amplification of the  To predict molecular groups, we used elastic net classifiers which were optimized using 10-fold cross validation repeated 3 times on the discovery cohort, where the true label was defined as the original molecular group assignment. For each sample in this cohort, a predicted molecular group (MG) was generated by training models on all remaining samples ( For feature selection, differential methylation analysis was performed in a pairwise fashion between each input group label using the  Once the model configuration was determined, an elastic net classifier (a form of regularized logistic regression) was trained using the full discovery cohort and used to predict the molecular group on our combined validation cohort. The training parameters were identical to those used in the model optimization. The biological profiles of these predicted molecular groups were compared to the molecular descriptions of the original cohort using methylation, clinical, and orthogonal genomic data (RNA sequencing and somatic point mutation data from whole-exome sequencing). Inferred copy number changes were also compared between cohorts, with a specific focus on canonical MG-specific gains/losses such as loss of chromosome 1p, gain of chromosome 1q, and loss of chromosome 22q. A subset of the validation cohort with available RNA sequencing data was used as further validation of the biological recapitulation of our original molecular groups. Single sample gene set variation analysis (ssGSVA), Within the validation cohort, differential gene expression analysis was performed between each predicted molecular group and the remaining samples ( As further validation of our predicted molecular groups, we compared the inferred cell proportions in our discovery and validation cohorts using CIBERSORTx. For continuous variables, a student’s  Full details of our discovery ( Baseline Characteristics of the Discovery and Validation Cohorts Bold values indicate  Given the previous finding that  Predicted molecular groups recapitulate the methylation signatures, inferred copy number profiles, and outcomes of the original molecular groups.

Cases assigned as “ Given that stereotypical CNAs were specific to some molecular groups in their original description, we refined the methylation model output using CNA data inferred from DNA methylation (effectively creating a 3-layer model using only DNA methylation as input data).

Of these 1378 cases, 68 (4.9%) cases had final assignments that were refined by their inferred CNV profiles. Two hundred and seventy-three cases (19.8%) were classified as  Given the observation that specific chromosome arms are stereotypically gained or lost in an MG-specific manner, we also compared inferred copy number changes of our final MG predictions in the validation cohort to those described in the original discovery cohort ( Of the 199 “undifferentiated” cases which were not confidently assigned to a single group, 65 (32.7%) had final output model probabilities <0.5 and 134 (67.3%) were assigned as  We next sought to compare molecular group-specific outcomes in the validation cohort to the discovery cohort ( We next sought to further validate the biological fidelity of the predicted molecular groups using orthogonal genomic platforms, which were not used in our classifier’s training or predictions. We first investigated the somatic point mutation profiles of a subset of the validation cohort with available whole-exome sequencing ( Validation of predicted molecular groups using orthogonal genomic platforms. (A) Whole-exome sequencing reveals similar molecular group-specific patterns of mutations between cohorts, with  Given that the transcriptional profiles of the originally described consensus molecular groups were highly distinct, we used RNA sequencing to further characterize the biology of predicted molecular groups in the validation cohort ( As further confirmation of the transcriptome-level validity of our predicted molecular groups, we computed the expression of group-specific gene signatures generated during the initial discovery of these groups Finally, we inferred the relative proportions of neoplastic cells, macrophages,  The inclusion of TERT promoter mutations and CDKN2A deletions to classify meningioma represents a significant update to the longstanding histopathology-based WHO criteria. While methylation profiling is not currently part of the standard of care in meningioma management and is not available at many laboratories, it is becoming increasingly accessible as the cost of genomic profiling decreases, further mitigated by using microarray-based technologies Our institution routinely applies a previously published DNA methylation-based nomogram to stratify meningiomas into high and low risk groups, The results of our study should be considered in the context of some limitations. First, the labels in our training are based on assignments from prior clustering analyses, which are associated with inherent stochasticity. Basing our classifier on a different datatype such as RNA sequencing, furthermore, may have led to differing results; notably, DNA methylation was chosen given its increasing role in tumor classification and its ability to robustly infer copy number profiles. Tumors which are not fully encapsulated by a single molecular group in either cohort, for example, could unpredictably skew results. To mitigate this in our classifier, we have built in confidence scores that are returned to the user and return the result of “undifferentiated” for cases where prediction probabilities are low, suggesting a case that is not fully encapsulated by a single molecular group. Of course, this comes with the caveat that a small minority of patients will not have a robust molecular group assignment, and other approaches such as outcome prediction models and copy number profiling will be needed to help prognosticate those cases. Secondly, most samples collected and included in this study were done so in a retrospective manner and so the limitations of retrospective data collection remain. However, the inclusion of valuable prospectively-collected, uniformly treated samples from the RTOG-0539 trial, and the large size and multi-institutional nature of our validation cohort addresses some of these limitations. Overall, we present a novel meningioma molecular classifier using only DNA methylation data as input and rigorously demonstrate its validity using a large, multi-centered cohort of 1698 patients including samples from the prospective RTOG-0539 clinical trial. This represents an important step toward increasingly personalized care for patients with meningioma and will help usher in a new era of molecularly-stratified clinical trials.

      "title": "Increasing incidence and prevalence of Hodgkin’s lymphoma in Finland: a population-based registry study",
      "content": "Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL) is a lymphoid malignancy with an emphasized incidence in developed countries. This study aimed to assess the changes in the epidemiology of HL in Finland at the population level by utilizing data from six nationwide healthcare registries. A total of 2912 patients with HL, diagnosed and treated between 2000 and 2019 were matched by controls and divided into younger (<50 years) and older cohorts (≥50 years) for analysis. A slightly increasing trend in incidence per age group was observed. For the younger patients, the mean annual incidence was 3.19 for males and 2.89 for females. For the older patients, it was 3.07 and 1.59, respectively. Finland has higher incidence rates than other Scandinavian countries possibly due to unique human leucocyte antigen allele distribution. There was a notable increase in prevalence. For females, this was particularly emphasized between the ages of 30–50 years, while among males, it was more evenly distributed across all ages. As a result of improved disease management, the proportion of HL survivors is increasing. Lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of cancers, classified into more than hundred subtypes according to the WHO-HAEMV5 classification [ Globally, the age-standardized incidence of all lymphomas has increased [ Prior epidemiological studies have focused on the incidence of HL; however, limited data are available on prevalence of HL and trends in occurrence over time. Reporting prevalence and incidence is significant since survivors of HL may be at risk for late morbidity [ The patient cohort included 2912 incident patients with a record of HL (the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision; ICD-10-code C81*) diagnosis in the Finnish Cancer Registry (FCR). Patients were diagnosed between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2019 in Finland and divided into two patient cohorts: the younger (age <50 years at diagnosis) and the older (age ≥50 years at diagnosis) cohorts. A 1:1-ratio age, sex, and region of Finland matched control population was created from the Digital and Population Data Services Agency (DPA). A control was considered eligible for the control cohort if he/she was alive without a lymphoma diagnosis between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2019 at the index of the corresponding case. In the corresponding cases, the controls were followed up based on the lymphoma index (lymphoma diagnosis). For <5 patients, a match with the same home municipality could not be found, therefore patients received controls without a regional match. The younger cohort included 1855 patients, of whom 53.6% (994 patients) were male. The older patient cohort included 1057 patients, of whom 65% (661 patients) were male. For prevalence calculations, we included all patients who had been diagnosed with HL and were alive in the index year. Incidence data included all patients with a first diagnosis of HL during the study period. This retrospective registry study utilized data collected from six Finnish healthcare registries: the FCR (HL diagnosis), National Institute of Health and Welfare (HL diagnosis, treatments), the Social Insurance Institution of Finland and the Finnish Centre for Pensions (daily sickness allowance, pension, etc. resources), Statistics Finland (socioeconomical status), and Digital and Population Data Services Agency (gathering of controls). These were nationwide registries, as such, the data covered the entire population of Finland (∼5.6 million in 2019). The Finnish Social and Health Data Permit Authority (Findata, permit no. THL/1541/14.02.00/2021) and Statistics Finland (data permit no. TK/3616/07.03.00/2021) granted permission for data collection. Prevalence data were extracted from the FCR by using ICD-10 code C81. Using only existing data retrieved from the registries, analyses were performed using R software version 4.0.3. Missing values were not imputed. Statistical significance was set at  Annual incidence, age-standardized annual incidence, and incidence by age group were calculated. The age-standardized annual incidence was scaled by the global distribution by the WHO [ Monthly incidences, which took into account month-length, were scaled to correspond to the annual incidence per 100 000 persons. Demographic characteristics and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) were evaluated at the index. Sociological variables (e.g. number of biological children, educational level, and socioeconomic status) were evaluated using the most recent data available before diagnosis. CCI was calculated based on comorbidities and co-diagnoses, which, compared to baseline, had been recorded during 5 years prior to HL diagnosis. The CCI was calculated from the original scoring system [ Median and first and third quartile (interquartile range) were reported for continuous variables. Categorical variables were reported as numbers and percentages. Traditional tests were used to assess the differences between patients and cohorts. The chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test was used for categorical variables and the Kruskal–Wallis test was used for continuous variables. Paired tests were not performed because of the small sample sizes of some subgroups. No multiple test correction was applied. The demographic characteristics of patients and controls are presented in  Demographic and clinical characteristics of the younger (<50 years) and older cohort (≥50 years) Small patient groups (<5 patients) were not reported in detail. The total number of patients diagnosed with HL was 2912 between 2000 and 2019. A total of 1655 patients (56.8%) were male. Of the patients, 1855 (63.7%) were under the age of 50 years and 1057 (36.3%) were 50 years or older. Of those under 50 years, 994 (53.6%) were male, and of those over 50 years, 661 (62.5%) were male. The mean annual incidence between 2000 and 2019 was 2.72 per 100 000. The annual incidence increased between 2000 and 2019 from 2.35 per 100 000 to 3.22 per 100 000 ( The annual incidence between 2000 and 2019 according to sex is presented in  (A) The annual incidence of Hodgkin’s lymphoma by sex. (B) The annual incidence of Hodgkin’s lymphoma for patients <50 years by sex. (C) The annual incidence of Hodgkin’s lymphoma for patients ≥50 years by sex.

The annual incidence in the younger cohort according to sex is presented in  The annual incidence in the older cohort according to sex is presented in  Incidence had bimodal age distribution by sex ( No statistically significant seasonal variation was seen in the incidence ( The trends in HL prevalence between 1990 and 2021 are presented in  (A) The age-standardized prevalence of Hodgkin’s lymphoma for males by age group. (B) The age-standardized prevalence of Hodgkin’s lymphoma for females by age group. Age-standardized prevalence rates and absolute cases numbers of Hodgkin’s lymphoma \n This study evaluated the trends in the incidence and prevalence of HL in the Finnish population between 2000 and 2019. Our study found two age peaks in the incidence of HL. The incidence rate increased slightly during the study period. We found a remarkable increase in the prevalence of up to two to three times in the oldest age group during study time. HL is a rare type of cancer, accounting for 0.4% of all cancers and of ∼10% of all lymphomas. Its incidence is higher in males than in females [ The aetiology of HL is incompletely understood, however, there are known risk factors. Genetic factors interfere with the aetiology of HL [ Based on our results, comorbidities were more common in patients with HL than in controls in both age groups. However, diagnostic bias cannot be excluded. Comorbidities are more likely to be diagnosed among patients with HL owing to closer medical examinations. In 2020, the global HL age-adjusted incidence rate was 0.98 per 100 000 [ In a global comparison [ The incidence of HL is lower in the USA than in Finland. In the USA, the age-adjusted incidence was 2.5 per 100 000 per year between 2016 and 2020, and decreased by ∼1.6% per year between 2010 and 2019 [ A previous registry study showed that the incidence varies seasonally, especially at higher latitudes, with the incidence being higher in winter and lower in summer [ Few studies have described the trends in the prevalence of HL [ Unfortunately, HL treatment has toxic late effects, such as secondary malignancies and cardiovascular diseases, which cause excess mortality among long-term survivors. MOPP with large-field radiotherapy, MOPP/ABV with or without radiotherapy, BEACOPP (bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, procarbazine, and prednisone) increased the risk of secondary leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, which have a poor prognosis after HL. Radiotherapy increases the risk of breast cancer. The larger the chest radiation field size or dose, the greater the risk. Alkylating chemotherapy, on the other hand, have protective effect against breast cancer. However, the risk of lung and gastrointestinal cancers increases after HL treatment. Large-dose radiotherapy to the mediastinum increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, valvular disease, pericardial disease, arrhythmia, and cardiomyopathy [ A limitation of this study is the lack of detailed treatment information. In addition, as a real-world evidence-based study, registry data and errors in recording may exist. However, these registries are, in general, comprehensive, and reliable. The strengths of our study include the possibility to combine multiple registries, high coverage of data collection and a long study period. Despite socioeconomic status, all permanent residents in Finland are entitled to public healthcare, thus the data are nationwide, covering the entire population in Finland. Each patient with a HL was matched to controls by age, sex, and region. In summary, the incidence of HL is high in Finland compared to global rates. The incidence of HL has increased slightly, whereas prevalence has increased considerably. The considerably increased prevalence has resulted in an increasing number of long-term HL survivors in Finland who require follow-up for late effects. Finland has a different incidence trend than the USA and Sweden, although there is no clear reason for this. The reason for the increase in incidence and the difference between the USA and Sweden require further investigations. We observed seasonal variation in incidence in Finland. Vitamin D’s protective role might explain this variation, however more studies are necessary to elucidate this variation.",

      "title": "Advances in research on the correlation between LTCCBs and cardiovascular diseases: A review",
      "content": "The prevalence of cardiovascular diseases has been rising globally, and various therapies have made significant strides in controlling the progression of these conditions and improving prognosis. Among these, pharmacological therapies have evolved rapidly and are increasingly integrated into clinical practice. Pharmacological treatments play a pivotal role in both basic research and clinical applications, particularly in deriving accurate conclusions from drug-related trials to address clinical challenges in drug selection and improve the cure rates of various diseases. L-type calcium channel blockers (LTCCBs) have attracted considerable research attention in recent years. With the accelerated development of novel drugs, the range of LTCCBs-based drug types has also diversified. This review aims to explore the relationship between LTCCBs and conditions such as hypertension, arrhythmias, ischemia–reperfusion injury, and cardiomyopathy, with the goal of contributing to the diversification of treatment options for cardiovascular diseases patients. Additionally, it seeks to establish a theoretical foundation for future research and the clinical application of these therapies. It is imperative to conduct a thorough analysis and in-depth discussion regarding the deficiencies in the medication process as well as various application scenarios. With the advancement of science and the introduction of novel drugs into clinical practice, it is anticipated that these developments will play a critical guiding role in the diagnosis and treatment of complex clinical diseases. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are a diverse group of drugs in terms of both structure and function, and they can be classified into dihydropyridines (e.g., nifedipine) and non-dihydropyridines (e.g., verapamil). LTCCs provide the calcium influx necessary to trigger cardiac contraction in a graded manner, regulated by the amplitude and kinetics of the L-type calcium current (ICa-L). The inactivation of LTCCs is controlled by voltage-dependent inactivation and calcium-dependent inactivation, which finely tunes calcium flux. LTCCs, also known as Cav1, are voltage-gated calcium channels that play key roles in a wide range of physiological processes, including neurotransmission, muscle contraction, and gene expression. Dysregulation of calcium channels has been implicated in neurological, cardiovascular, muscular, and psychiatric disorders. The regulation of specific biological processes also depends on the interplay between membrane potential changes and ion concentration shifts. For example, high-voltage-activated calcium channels (Cav1/Cav2) in excitable cells convert action potentials into Ca CCBs remain a cornerstone of pharmacotherapy for CVDs, with their effects demonstrated across a range of drugs. For example, nimodipine, a dihydropyridine CCBs, blocks the influx of extracellular calcium through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. In 2018, the European Society of Cardiology and the European Society of Hypertension proposed a conventional definition of hypertension, that is, BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. A large body of evidence indicates that selecting appropriate drug combinations is crucial for controlling blood pressure. LTCCBs have been widely used as antihypertensive agents in clinical practice. In recent years, many studies have focused on experimental research related to spontaneous hypertension, particularly in terms of blood pressure reduction. Wang et al, As research has progressed, studies on channel-regulating substances have gradually increased. In an experiment by Reyes et al, Arrhythmias typically refer to disturbances in the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. Sinoatrial node cardiomyocytes exhibit automatic and rhythmic electrical activity, and their rate is influenced by inputs from the autonomic nervous system. For instance, sympathetic nerves increase heart rate by activating the β-adrenergic receptor (β-ARs) signaling cascade, and LTCCs activity facilitates membrane depolarization, serving as a central target of β-ARs signaling. The development of drugs based on plant extracts has become a research hotspot in recent years. Liu et al, Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a common cause of hospital admissions and can cause significant discomfort and distress in patients. The most common types include atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentrant tachycardia, AV reentrant tachycardia, and atrial tachycardia. IR injury is a pathological process that occurs in multiple organs throughout the body, often associated with severe cellular damage and death. A considerable number of studies have demonstrated that different drugs of the same class can exert varying degrees of efficacy in specific conditions. Nessa et al Quercetin has been identified in recent years as a factor with significant therapeutic potential for myocardial IR injury. Liang et al, Significant progress has been made in the taxonomy of myocardial diseases over the past 25 years, with new cardiomyopathies, such as arrhythmogenic, restrictive, and non-compaction cardiomyopathies, being discovered and added to the updated World Health Organization classification. Ca Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic cardiomyopathy characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy in the absence of conditions such as hypertension. In conclusion, LTCCBs exhibit significant associations with a wide range of CVDs, as evidenced by the multiple studies discussed. Detailed research findings are summarized in “Table  Confirmatory studies investigating the association between LTCCBs and cardiovascular diseases. LTCCBs = L-type calcium channel blockers. As LTCCBs are a subclass of CCBs, the limitations observed in the general application of CCBs provide insight into areas where LTCCBs still require improvement. Dihydropyridine (DHP)-based CCBs are generally preferred in the long-acting formulation, as short-acting CCBs, while effective in lowering blood pressure, often accelerate heart rate and increase myocardial oxygen consumption. Common side effects include palpitations, flushing, headache, and lower limb edema, with occasional gum hyperplasia. Non-DHP CCBs, on the other hand, are typically used as first-line treatment for patients with chronic stable angina; however, due to their inhibitory effects on cardiac contractility and conduction, they are contraindicated in patients with second- or third-degree AV block and heart failure (HF). Additionally, their combined use with β-blockers can exacerbate conduction block and reduce myocardial contractility, necessitating cautious monitoring. Peripheral edema is considered one of the common adverse effects associated with CCBs, believed to be secondary to small arterial dilation, which increases capillary pressure and leads to fluid extravasation into the interstitial space, resulting in edema. Makani et al confirmed that the incidence of peripheral edema gradually increases with the duration of CCBs treatment, up to 6 months. In the long term, more than 5% of patients discontinue CCBs use due to this adverse effect. Both non-DHP CCBs and lipophilic DHP CCBs have lower incidence rates of edema. From a mechanistic perspective, non-DHP CCBs exhibit negative inotropic and negative chronotropic effects. These drugs can decrease myocardial contractility, improve ventricular filling, alleviate myocardial ischemia, and reduce left ventricular hypertrophy. Drugs like verapamil and diltiazem delay AV node conduction, increase the AV node refractory period, and are used in the treatment of hemodynamically stable SVT or recurrent SVT that cannot be terminated by adenosine or vagal maneuvers. However, in patients with pre-excitation syndrome and accessory pathway-mediated paroxysmal SVT, non-DHP CCBs may shorten the refractory period of the accessory pathway, resulting in an accelerated ventricular rate and potentially triggering ventricular fibrillation or hypotension, thus making them contraindicated in these cases. Helmer et al The use of CCBs, either as monotherapy or in combination with other cardiovascular drugs, demonstrates varying degrees of effectiveness in the treatment of chronic kidney disease complicated by hypertension. Among the combinations, CCBs combined with ACEI or ARB provide the best therapeutic outcomes, with the lowest incidence of adverse effects. However, the antihypertensive efficacy and adverse effect profiles of CCBs show considerable interindividual variability, influenced by genetic polymorphisms in genes such as  This review integrates numerous research findings to summarize how LTCCBs play important roles in the diagnosis and treatment of various CVDs. Simultaneously, an in-depth examination was performed on the various scenarios of drug application, along with an identification of potential areas for enhancement, to foster the optimization of clinical drug application in future contexts. Expanding knowledge of related molecular biological pathways and clarifying unexplored pathways to improve the combined efficacy of these drugs is essential for enhancing the therapeutic effects of drug treatments (e.g., long-acting, medium-acting, and short-acting formulations). A growing body of evidence suggests that further research is needed to confirm the specific efficacy and safety of these therapies, ensuring better adherence among patients during treatment. Moreover, the development of new LTCCBs should be accelerated to address increasingly complex disease variations. Establishing connections between natural herb-based compounds and clinically applied drugs, along with elucidating their mechanisms and targets, could expedite the development of novel drugs. Additionally, quantifying the inhibitory effects of these drugs could facilitate a new systematic classification for both existing and emerging drugs. Large-scale clinical trials on synthetic drugs of this class should be conducted, and after clarifying the molecular and genetic pathways involved, further exploration of how to optimally combine clinically applied drugs with new agents would be meaningful for enhancing therapeutic outcomes. In the future, large clinical trials could explore innovations in the pathways of normal gene functions, using point mutation genes as a starting point, which would be of even greater significance.

      "title": "Hemichorea Associated With Nigrostriatal Dysfunction: Case Report of a Patient With an Ipsilateral Infarct in the Lenticular Nucleus and Internal Capsule",
      "content": "Hemichorea is a rare manifestation of ischemic stroke whose lesion is typically located in the contralateral basal ganglia. Its pathomechanism has not been elucidated completely; however, it may be related to nigrostriatal dysfunction. In patients with hemichorea, dopamine transporter-single photon emission computed tomography (DAT-SPECT) reportedly displayed decreased tracer accumulation in the contralateral striatum. Moreover, in exceptional cases, responsible lesions were located in the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere. This case report describes an 84-year-old man who presented with three weeks of intermittent, involuntary, and twisting movements in his right limbs. On physical examination, the patient had right-sided hemichorea without other neurological deficits. The choreic movements were more frequent in the lower limb than in the upper and provoked when he tried to take a certain posture or engaged in mental arithmetic. Magnetic resonance imaging performed on suspicion of stroke detected a right hemispheric subacute infarct in the posterior part of the lenticular nucleus and posterior limb of the internal capsule. Furthermore, DAT-SPECT revealed decreased tracer accumulation in the right striatum. He was administered oral antiplatelet medication after being diagnosed with lacunar infarction. The choreic movements gradually reduced over the next 8 months and eventually disappeared. The lesion in the lenticular nucleus and internal capsule was considered to have induced ipsilesional hemichorea, considering the temporal proximity between the hemichorea and ischemic stroke. Although DAT-SPECT findings in patients with ipsilesional hemichorea have not been reported, this case suggests that nigrostriatal dopamine dysfunction can contribute to the pathogenesis of ipsilesional hemichorea. Chorea is a hyperkinetic disorder that entails involuntary, nonrhythmic, and flowing movements in the face, neck, trunk, or limbs [ The lesion responsible for hemichorea is traditionally located in the contralateral subthalamic nucleus (STN). The presence of lesions in the cerebral cortex, caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, or thalamus can also evoke contralesional hemichorea [ Hemichorea is currently hypothesized to result from dysfunction of the hyperdirect and/or indirect pathways in the contralateral basal ganglia [ Herein, we report the rare case of a patient with ipsilesional hemichorea in whom magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected a small ischemic lesion in the lenticular nucleus and internal capsule. Moreover, DAT-SPECT revealed decreased tracer accumulation in the striatum of the symptomatic side. An 84-year-old right-handed man visited our hospital because he experienced intermittent, involuntary, and twisting movements in his right limbs for three weeks. Although the frequency of the spontaneous movements was decreasing, these movements sometimes occurred when he used chopsticks at meals or when he tried to stand up. It was not apparent whether the onset of the movements was sudden or insidious. He had a medical history of diabetes mellitus, gastric cancer that was successfully resected 5 years earlier without recurrence, and reflux esophagitis. Head trauma or neurosurgical procedures were not mentioned in the anamnesis. His familial history was unremarkable and did not include neurodegenerative diseases. The patient's oral medications were saxagliptin 5 mg/day, mitiglinide calcium 30 mg/day, and mosapride citrate 15 mg/day. On physical examination, intermittent choreic movements were observed in his right upper and lower extremities. The movements predominantly appeared in the lower extremity of the affected side and became more apparent when he tried to adopt a certain posture or performed mental arithmetic (Supporting video ( MRI was performed on suspicion of stroke. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging revealed a high-intensity lesion in the posterior part of the right lenticular nucleus and posterior limb of the right internal capsule (arrow,  DAT-SPECT with  In the presented case, a small lesion in the lenticular nucleus and internal capsule was considered to have caused ipsilesional hemichorea because of the temporal proximity between the hemichorea and ischemic stroke. Moreover, DAT-SPECT revealed decreased tracer accumulation in the striatum of the symptomatic side. Hemichorea, a rare manifestation of ischemic stroke, is usually caused by lesions of the lenticular nucleus, STN, or cerebral cortex on the contralateral side [ The mechanism of chorea has not been completely elucidated; however, some major hypotheses can be found in the literature. The basal ganglia consist of the striatum, globus pallidus interna and externa (GPi and GPe), STN, and substantia nigra pars compacta and reticulata (SNc and SNr). According to a major hypothesis, there are three important pathways when processing information from the cerebral cortex [ Despite the unapparent causal association between dopaminergic dysfunction and hemichorea, DAT-SPECT was reported to detect decreased tracer accumulation in the contralateral striatum. An 82-year-old man with hyperglycemia (blood glucose level: 590 mg/dL) presented with left-sided hemichorea and hemiballism. MRI displayed a T1-weighted hyperintense lesion in the right putamen. Moreover, on DAT-SPECT, decreased tracer accumulation was found in the right striatum [ The mechanism of ipsilesional hemichorea remains elusive; however, some speculations have been introduced in previous articles. In an article, patients with ipsilesional hemichorea were speculated to have the congenital uncrossed pyramidal tract or active uncrossed pyramidal tract [ The current patient was a diabetic and had elevated levels of hemoglobin A1c and random blood glucose; therefore, diabetic chorea was included in the differential diagnosis. In addition, as described above, patients with diabetic chorea reportedly had decreased tracer uptake in the striatum on DAT-SPECT. However, hemoglobin A1c and random blood glucose levels of the presented case were low as compared with those reported in patients with diabetic chorea [ In this case presentation, the patient was diagnosed as having lacunar infarction and treated with oral clopidogrel. The ischemic MRI lesion was less than 20 mm in greatest diameter and located in the territory of the right basal penetrating arteries, accompanied by no apparent stenosis in the trunk and major branches of the right middle cerebral artery. These findings indicated the ischemic lesion was classified as lacunar infarction [ The mechanism of ipsilesional hemichorea has not been elucidated possibly because of its rarity. Therefore, accumulation of case reports may be important and lead to the better understanding of this infrequent chorea. A major limitation of this report is that more cases with ipsilesional chorea are necessary to obtain robust conclusions regarding the DAT-SPECT findings. In summary, this case report has demonstrated that hemichorea can be observed with an ipsilateral cerebral lesion. Moreover, the observed involuntary movements may be associated with ipsilateral nigrostriatal dopamine dysfunction.",

      "title": "Identification of drug and food allergy in surgery clinic: Automation system and red wristband combination",
      "content": "Correct identification of drug and food allergies in hospitalized patients is important to prevent unwanted allergic reactions or unnecessary treatment changes. This study aimed to explain the working principle of digital patient identification systems used for drug and food allergy recording and to evaluate the results by analyzing the allergy recording system data of the general surgery clinic in our center. In our single-center, retrospective study, all patients admitted to general surgery services between January 01, 2023 and December 31, 2023 were included. Patients who were given an identifying red wristband and had allergy information on their digital patient card panel were included in the study. Patients with repeated hospitalizations within the total number of patients were included in the study as 1 patient. Data from 5810 patients hospitalized in the general surgery department for 1-year were analyzed. In total, 759 patients with allergy labels were included in this study. Of these, 241 (31.8%) were male and 518 (68.2%) were female, and the mean age was 58.81 ± 15.77 (18–96). The drug allergy, antibiotic allergy, and penicillin allergy rates were 7.2%, 3.8%, and 2.1%, respectively. Food allergy was detected in 1.5% of the total patient group. The most frequently reported allergenic foods were tomatoes, mushrooms, spices, eggs, milk and dairy products, respectively. We recommend the use of identifying wristbands, such as red wristbands, to ensure that the allergy history of hospitalized patients is correctly questioned and that patients with allergies are labeled. We also believe that protocols for allergy labels should be developed in health centers. Drug allergy (DA) is defined as a hypersensitivity reaction to drugs that is mediated by specific antibodies or T lymphocytes. Its epidemiological risk factors are not fully understood, and severe symptoms range from mild manifestations such as erythema, skin rash, pruritus to anaphylaxis, and mortality may be observed. Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are common problems in drug allergies and may deprive patients of optimal drug choices. Similar to DA, food allergy (FA) can cause symptoms ranging from mild to anaphylaxis. The basis of FA treatment is the avoidance of allergens and use of appropriate diet lists. Food-derived substances used to maintain stability or bioavailability during the manufacturing process of medicines can lead to unpredictable allergic reactions. In hospitalized patients, it is essential to question and record the patient’s history of allergy to a known drug to prevent possible medication errors. Patients may have extra allergy labels owing to vague symptoms that do not correspond to true allergic reactions or lack of information. Occasionally, allergic reactions occur when patients with allergies are not labeled. An inaccurately defined history of allergy leads to increased use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, increased potential side effects, higher risk of infection by resistant bacteria, increased treatment costs, and prolonged hospitalization. This study primarily aimed to explain the working principles of digital patient identification systems used in recording drug and food allergies of hospitalized patients. Secondly, it was aimed to analyze the data of the digital allergy recording system in the general surgery clinic and make inferences about the results. All patients admitted to general surgery services between January 01, 2023 and December 31, 2023 were included in our single-center study conducted in our hospital, which is a tertiary city hospital and the largest health center in the region. The data of the patients were retrospectively examined through the Hospital Information Management System (HIMS) used by our hospital and patient files. Our city hospital, located in a region with a population density of approximately 7 million, is the reference center and the largest health facility in the region. Our hospital is a health complex serving as a third-level training and research hospital with a total bed capacity of 2682, and 426 of which are intensive care beds, consisting of 8 different blocks. The general surgery clinic consists of 7 specialized subunits and has a total bed capacity of 168. In our hospital, colored wristbands are used to correctly identify patients within the scope of quality standards. All standard patients admitted to the units in our health facility are given a “white” colored identification wristband. If the patient has a history of allergies, a “red” wristband is worn. Different colored wristbands are also available and are used according to the medical condition and history of the patients (Fig.  Identifying patient wristbands (A) white color – for standard patients; (B) red color – for patients with allergies; (C) green color – for patients with catheters or ports; (D) QR code reading and identifying wristband printing machines. The first anamnesis of patients admitted to the clinic is taken by the physician and nurse. After a protocol number is defined for each patient via HIMS, a digital patient card is created. All previous medical records of the patient and the warning panels related to these records can be viewed on this digital screen. If the patient has an allergy history on their digital card, the warning panels are activated and a red identification wristband is automatically created for the patient (Fig.  Warning panels on the digital patient card. Allergy testing is not routinely performed on patients who report an allergy history, and allergy labels are given according to the patient’s declaration or previous medical records. On the screen where allergy information is entered, there are sections for drug allergies, food allergies, allergic diseases and other allergies (Fig.  Allergy information entry fields (arrow) and allergy warning symbol (star) on the digital patient card. Both the active ingredient information and the market name of the drug with the specified allergy are recorded in the system. The drug information entered in this field is integrated into the digital pharmacy system and all drug groups containing the active ingredient are automatically included in the allergic drug category. In the digital drug order system, warning panels are activated when a drug with allergy information is prescribed (Fig.  Warning screen that appears when a drug with an allergy is entered in the digital order system. The allergenic food name of patients reporting food allergies is recorded in the system. The patient’s diet is recorded on the patient’s digital patient card at the first admission. If an allergic food is reported, a consultation is requested from the nutrition and dietetics department to create a special diet for the patient. During meal distribution, the meals are brought to the patient rooms by scanning the QR code-enabled wristbands. For example, a patient whose egg allergy information is entered is not given eggs or any foods containing eggs. We decided to conduct our study on patients hospitalized in a general surgery clinic, considering that treatments for surgical diseases are likely to outweigh other patient characteristics. We thought that we would provide a suitable study population due to the importance of both antibiotic prophylaxis or treatments and patient nutrition regimens in gastrointestinal surgeries in the treatment process. All patients hospitalized in the general surgery services of our hospital during a 1-year period throughout 2023 were retrospectively scanned from HIMS and patient files. During this period, patients who wore a red wristband and had allergy information in the HIMS digital patient card were included in the study. Patients with recurrent hospitalizations were included in the study as 1 patient. Patients with missing data were excluded from the study. Patients who were classified as allergic patients due to allergic asthma, seasonal allergy, pollen allergy, cosmetic product allergy, but did not have food or DA were identified. A preliminary analysis was conducted including the data of these patients in order to determine the rates of inappropriate allergy labeling. Then, the data of patients with inappropriate allergy labels were excluded from the study and the data of patients with drug and/or FA labels were analyzed. Age, gender, history of DA, active ingredient names in drug allergies, and allergenic food type in food allergies were recorded. Patients with drug and/or food allergies were called the “allergy label group” in the study, and the total number of patients hospitalized in the general surgery clinic during the study period was called the “study population.” SPSS 25.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago) analysis program was used for statistical evaluation of the data. Categorical measurements were summarized as numbers and percentages, and continuous measurements were summarized as mean and standard deviation (median and minimum–maximum where appropriate). The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to determine whether the parameters in the study showed normal distribution. The Local Ethics Committee for Clinical Research (Date: June 12, 2024, Decision No. 23) approval was obtained for our single-center and retrospective observational study. All procedures were performed in accordance with ethical rules and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients are required to sign informed consent forms for the procedures to be performed in the clinic during hospitalization. The data of a total of 5810 patients hospitalized in the general surgery clinic during a 1-year period were scanned and recurrent hospitalizations were recorded once. During the study period, data on 759 patients who used red wristbands and had an allergy warning in the digital patient record system were accessed. The rate of these patients in the entire sample was 13%. However, in the patient group with allergy warnings, allergy labels were also applied to patients who reported that they were allergic to cosmetic products, cleaning chemicals, house dust, pollen, and bee stings. Patients who wore red wristbands for reasons other than food or drug allergies constituted 35% of the patient group with allergy warnings. Demographic data for patients tagged with allergy warning systems are summarized in Table  Demographic data and distribution of subgroups for all allergy labels. min–max = minimum–maximum, SD = standard deviation. Data from 500 patients with drug and/or FA labels were reanalyzed. After this stage, the patient group with drug and/or FA labels (N = 500) was named as the “allergy label group” in the presentation of the analysis data. In addition, the group of all patients hospitalized in the general surgery service during the study period (N = 5810) was named “study population.” The rate of allergy label group in the study population was measured as 8.6%. Four hundred twenty (84%) patients with DA, 92 (18.4%) patients with FA and 12 (2.4%) patients with both drug and FA were identified. The rates of patients with drug, food and both allergy labels in the study population were 7.22%, 1.58%, and 0.20%, respectively. The number of women among patients reporting allergy history was clearly prominent. 339 (67.8%) of the patients in the allergy label group, 288 (68.57%) in the DA group, and 59 (64.10%) in the FA group were women. In the allergy label group, the mean age of the patients was 52.02 ± 15.93 (18–96) and the number of patients younger than 65 was 387 (77.4%). Age analysis of other subgroups is given in Table  Patient demographic data on drug and food labels. min–max = minimum–maximum, SD = standard deviation. Antibiotic allergy was detected in 221 patients, the rate of which was found to be 29.11% in the allergy label group, 52.61% in the DA group and 3.8% in the study population. Among the antibiotic allergies reported as active substance, the most common was penicillin allergy (N = 124) and the rates in the study population, allergy label group, DA group and antibiotic allergy group were determined as 2.13%, 24.8%, 29.52%, and 56.10%, respectively. Thirty-one patients who reported antibiotic allergy were recorded as having unknown antibiotic allergy because the active substance was unknown, and this group constituted 14% of antibiotic allergies, 7.38% of drug allergies, and 0.53% of the study population. The number of patients who reported multiple antibiotic allergies was 5 (1.19% of the DA group and 0.08% of the study population). The second most frequently detected subgroup among drug allergies was painkiller allergy. The rate of 112 patients in this subgroup was found to be 1.92% in the study population and 26.7% in the DA group. The 3 most frequently detected painkillers for which allergies were reported were NSAIDs, metamizole sodium and paracetamol. The rates in the painkiller allergy group were 52.7%, 21.4%, 19.6%, and the rates in the DA group were 14.04%, 5.71%, 5.23%, respectively. Allergy to contrast agents used for radiological imaging was detected in 13 patients. Contrast agent allergy constituted 0.22% of the study population and 3.1% of the DA group. In the digital system records, it was seen that a patient had an allergy to the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent gadolinium. However, during the patient’s hospitalization, an anaphylactic reaction developed during the computed tomography (CT) scan performed with the contrast agent and the patient was intubated and monitored in the intensive care unit. Therefore, both contrast agents are recorded on the allergy label. This patient died during the intensive care unit follow-up. The distribution of patients with DA labels according to subgroups is given in Table  Distribution of drug allergy labels by subgroups. MRI = magnetic resonance imaging, NSAIDs = nonsteroidal anti inflamatuar drugs, PPI = proton pump inhibitor.  The most common allergens among the active ingredients are listed. Ninety-two patients with FA labels were identified. These constituted 1.58% of the study population and 12.2% of the allergy label group. The most frequently recorded allergenic foods were tomatoes, mushrooms, spice products, eggs, milk and dairy products. Twelve patients in the allergy label group had both drug and food allergies, the rate in the study population being 0.20%. Five patients with mushroom allergy were also found to have penicillin allergy. Data for patients with other drug and food allergies are given in Table  Analysis of food allergy labels by food type. Only one patient died during the study period from anaphylactic shock caused by a substance other than that listed on the allergy label. No other patients with an allergy label experienced any adverse events due to allergic reactions. Our study presents the results of a detailed analysis of both food and DA rates in our high-volume general surgery clinic. In the literature, the number of publications addressing food and drug allergies together is quite limited. Although the number of patients with both food and DA labels is low, the high rate of co-occurrence of edible mushrooms and penicillin DA is striking. We could not find any data in the literature that could explain whether this situation is important or not. Even in a detailed study that shows that edible mushrooms cause food allergies and different allergic reactions and conveys the immunological stages of these allergic mechanisms, we could not see any information about the direct relationship between mushroom and penicillin DA. As in our study, individual drug allergens are reported to be significantly more prevalent in female patients in many studies. In addition, a history of DA has been reported more frequently in elderly patients due to the burden caused by polypharmacy. Studies have shown that surgical site infections have increased due to the decrease in the use of cefazolin for perioperative prophylaxis and the prescription of alternative antibiotics to β-lactams. Patients with reported penicillin allergy are often treated with alternative antibiotics that are broader in spectrum, more toxic, and more expensive. One study found a 69% increase in the risk of methicillin-resistant  After antibiotics, painkillers are the most common cause of drug allergies. Among painkillers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most commonly reported subgroup as shown in many studies. Paracetamol and opioids are among the other most common painkiller allergies. In a study of 2431 unique patients, NSAID allergy was reported in 20.7% and paracetamol allergy in 5.3%. Reports of allergy to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), one of the most commonly used drug groups for both treatment and prophylaxis, are becoming increasingly common. In a study, lansoprazole was reported to be the most common and rabeprazole was reported to be the subgroup with the least allergy history in the PPI group. In the past, radiologic contrast media were one of the most frequently reported groups of allergic reactions. With the introduction of nonionic, low-osmolar agents, allergic reactions to these agents have declined from 12% to 0.04%. Reactions to gadolinium used in MRI scans are much lower than reactions to radiologic contrast medias used in CT scans. Although reports of allergic reactions to these agents have decreased, drug reactions leading to fatal anaphylaxis can be observed. Fatal anaphylaxis due to allergies is fortunately quite rare. In a comprehensive study, it was emphasized that mortality for drug-induced anaphylaxis was estimated to be 0.05 to 0.51 per million people and 0.03 to 0.32 for food-induced anaphylaxis. It was reported that peanuts or tree nuts account for half of deaths from food-induced anaphylaxis. One of the biggest challenges with allergy labeling is that some of the symptoms that patients describe as allergies may not actually be allergy symptoms. The patients with allergy labels for reasons other than food or DA accounted for 35% of the entire allergy label group. Thomas et al reported that red wristbands were used to indicate the presence of allergy in 112 (52.6%) of 213 centers in their prospective multicenter study. Our study had some limitations due to its retrospective nature and the inclusion of patients admitted to only one clinic in a single-center. The main limitations were the lack of any confirmation test for allergies in patients with allergy labels and the lack of an institutional protocol for these patients. In addition, the lack of records of allergic reactions encountered in inpatients and the fact that it was not known whether any tests were performed for allergies after discharge were also weaknesses of our study. Despite all these, we find it valuable to thoroughly detail the rates of both drug and food allergies among all patients admitted to general surgery services within the 1-year period of our study. We believe that the results of this study will serve as a guide for changing the traditional practices of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in patients labeled with allergies. Additionally, we hope that the allergenic food sub-analysis related to food allergies in our study will encourage the use of personalized dietary treatments. Accurately inquiring about the allergy histories of hospitalized patients and labeling those with allergies is crucial for preventing potential adverse allergic reactions. Patients’ allergy statuses should be communicated through both identifying wristbands, such as red wristbands, and alert systems on digital patient records. We believe that educational programs should be implemented to increase the knowledge levels of both patients and healthcare professionals regarding allergy labels and that protocols related to allergy labeling should be developed in healthcare facilities.",

      "title": "Severe Anemia With Intraosseous-Intramuscular Hemorrhage in a Patient With Kit-C-Negative Systemic Mastocytosis",
      "content": "Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a rare hematologic disorder characterized by clonal proliferation of mast cells in various tissues, often presenting with skin lesions, gastrointestinal symptoms, or anaphylaxis. However, atypical presentations lacking these classical features may delay diagnosis and complicate management. We report the case of a 42-year-old woman who presented with progressive anemia, recurrent spontaneous intramuscular and intraosseous hemorrhages, and severe, unexplained pain. Notably, she lacked cutaneous signs or known allergic triggers. Extensive laboratory and imaging workups ruled out common hematologic and autoimmune causes. Bone marrow biopsy ultimately revealed multifocal clusters of atypical mast cells consistent with SM, despite the absence of the KIT D816V mutation. This case underscores the protean manifestations of SM and the need to maintain a high index of suspicion in patients with unexplained cytopenia and bleeding. It also highlights the role of bone marrow evaluation in the diagnostic pathway, even when classic clinical features are absent. Timely recognition of atypical SM can guide appropriate management and improve patient outcomes. Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a rare hematologic disorder characterized by the clonal proliferation and accumulation of mast cells, i.e., granulated immune cells that play a key role in allergic reactions and innate immunity, in various tissues, including the bone marrow, skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and spleen [ The clinical manifestations of SM are highly heterogeneous, reflecting both the extent of mast cell infiltration in various organs and the systemic effects of mast cell degranulation. Symptoms may range from indolent disease with minimal clinical impact to aggressive subtypes associated with multi-organ dysfunction and poor prognosis [ The absence of KIT mutations in certain cases further complicates diagnosis and underscores the need for heightened clinical suspicion. In patients presenting with unexplained cytopenias, bleeding diathesis, or bone marrow abnormalities, SM should be considered, particularly when other causes have been excluded. A comprehensive diagnostic approach, including bone marrow biopsy with immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry to detect aberrant mast cell markers (e.g., CD25, CD2), measurement of serum tryptase levels, and molecular analysis for KIT and non-KIT mutations, is essential for confirming the diagnosis [ This report aims to explore the hematologic manifestations of SM, with particular attention to mast cell-driven bleeding complications and the diagnostic nuances in KIT-negative cases. By highlighting an atypical presentation, this study emphasizes the importance of recognizing SM as a potential underlying cause of otherwise unexplained hematologic abnormalities. The patient is a 42-year-old female with a past medical history of asthma, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (performed in 2020), and depression who presented with abdominal pain and severe anemia. Initial presentation and diagnostic workup Five months before her diagnosis, the patient developed bilateral ribcage pain and dyspnea, leading to an emergency department (ED) visit, where she was diagnosed with pneumonia and prescribed antibiotics. She later developed left breast bruising and swelling and was treated empirically for soft tissue infection. Around the same time, she experienced persistent low back and buttock pain, unrelieved by steroids, followed by acute left pelvic pain radiating to her thigh, prompting another ED visit. At that time, her hemoglobin had dropped to 5.7 grams per deciliter (g/dL) from a baseline of ~10 g/dL. Abdominal and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without intravenous (IV) contrast showed hepatosplenomegaly and nontraumatic intraosseous and intramuscular hemorrhage in the left iliopsoas and gluteal regions (Figure  The differential diagnosis included infection and noninfectious inflammatory conditions, such as hemorrhagic myonecrosis and hemorrhagic bony infarcts. The patient received three units of packed red blood cells (pRBC) and was empirically treated for infectious myositis. Laboratory findings included a low Immunoglobulin G (IgG) level of 375 milligrams per deciliter (reference range: 767-1590 mg/dL), mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Extensive infectious testing, including blood cultures, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) PCR, hepatitis panel, Lyme immunoglobulin M and G (IgM, IgG), and  Progressive symptoms and hematologic evaluation Two weeks later, the patient was readmitted with hemoptysis and left ear pain. Examination revealed active bleeding in the left middle ear, which was draining through the Eustachian tube into the oropharynx, leading to expectoration of blood. Severe anemia returned with a hemoglobin level of 6 g/dL. She received two units of pPRBCs, after which her hemoglobin stabilized at 8.7 g/dL. A repeat ENT evaluation noted improvement in hemotympanum. MRI of the temporal bones and a CT scan of the neck to assess for paraganglioma; however, the patient declined these studies. The Hematology team was consulted and advised to start intravenous aminocaproic acid, followed by a transition to an oral formulation. However, due to difficulty swallowing large pills, the patient declined the oral medication and was instead switched to tranexamic acid (TXA), which she tolerated well. For discharge planning, Hematology recommended continuing TXA for an additional three days. Given the patient’s occasional complaints of flushing, a tryptase level was obtained and found to be markedly elevated at 1,191 micrograms per liter (mcg/L) (normal range <11 mcg/L), raising suspicion for mastocytosis. Testing for KIT mutation and beta-glucosidases was ordered to assess for mastocytosis and Gaucher’s disease, respectively, both of which can manifest with bleeding, osteonecrosis, and hepatosplenomegaly were negative. The patient was discharged home with close follow-up. The patient returned to the emergency department a week later with chest pain and intermittent, patchy skin rashes along with generalized fatigue. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) chest showed no pulmonary embolism (PE), a slight increase in bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis versus pneumonitis, a new indeterminate inflammatory process in the right chest wall/axilla, and a stable anterior mediastinal nodule. The initial bone marrow biopsy from the previous admission returned and showed significant abnormalities, including extensive necrosis, raising suspicion for mastocytosis. A right axilla biopsy and repeat bone marrow biopsy were done. Axilla biopsy indicated mastocytosis. A concurrent second bone marrow biopsy showed aggregates of necrotic ghost cells, with flow cytometry showing no evidence of lymphoproliferative disorder, acute leukemia, or increased blasts. Cytogenetics revealed a normal karyotype. Additional testing revealed elevated factor VIII level, ferritin, and LDH (Table  Acute pain crisis and confirmation of mastocytosis A few weeks later, while off steroids, the patient underwent a final bone marrow biopsy, which demonstrated a cellular marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis and no increase in blasts, indicating preserved hematopoietic function (Table  Mastocytosis is a rare condition characterized by excessive mast cell accumulation, primarily affecting the skin and bone marrow. Patients with unexplained anaphylaxis, recurrent flushing, chronic skin lesions such as urticaria pigmentosa, or persistently elevated serum tryptase levels should be evaluated for mastocytosis. Additional indications include unexplained cytopenia; osteopenia; chronic gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain; or unexplained bleeding. Individuals with a family history of mast cell disorders, resistant allergic conditions, or multi-organ involvement without a clear etiology should also be considered for further testing [ The World Health Organization (WHO) defines SM based on specific diagnostic criteria, including dense mast cell infiltrates in extracutaneous organs, marrow, or blood, as well as minor criteria such as atypical mast cell morphology, KIT D816V mutations, CD25 expression, and persistently elevated serum tryptase levels. Bone marrow biopsy is essential for detecting these abnormalities and confirming the diagnosis [ Diagnosing SM in patients who lack the KIT D816V mutation is particularly challenging. The KIT D816V mutation is identified in over 80% of SM cases, making it a key diagnostic marker. However, some patients exhibiting clinical and histopathologic features suggestive of SM test negative for this mutation, complicating the diagnostic process [ In KIT D816V-negative SM, the absence of this genetic marker necessitates a more extensive diagnostic approach, incorporating morphology, immunophenotyping, and serum biomarkers. Bone marrow biopsy remains essential, particularly in identifying increased mast cell burden, spindle-shaped mast cells, and aberrant CD25 expression. However, in some cases, mast cell infiltration may be minimal or obscured by extensive fibrosis and necrosis, leading to sampling inconsistencies and potential underdiagnosis [ Flow cytometry can help detect abnormal mast cells, even when histopathology is inconclusive. In addition, elevated serum tryptase levels serve as a useful diagnostic marker but may not always be present, especially in early or indolent SM cases. To further investigate the underlying pathology, next-generation sequencing (NGS) or whole-exome sequencing can identify alternative genetic mutations such as JAK2, TET2, SRSF2, ASXL1, or RUNX1, which are sometimes associated with KIT-negative SM, particularly in advanced or aggressive forms of the disease [ Due to these diagnostic challenges, patients with KIT-negative SM often require multiple bone marrow biopsies and serial assessments over time to reach a definitive diagnosis. Importantly, KIT negativity does not rule out SM, but rather suggests greater molecular and genetic variability, which may influence disease progression and treatment options [ Bleeding in mastocytosis results from multiple factors, including heparin release, platelet dysfunction, coagulopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, and vascular fragility [ A notable finding in this case was the presence of ghost cells in bone marrow, indicative of lysed or degenerated cells. In mastocytosis, these structures suggest mast cell degranulation, leading to the release of histamine, heparin, and other bioactive mediators. This process contributes to tissue damage, fibrosis, and, in advanced cases, bone marrow necrosis [ Management of SM depends on its subtype, symptom severity, and organ involvement, with treatment aimed at controlling symptoms, reducing mast cell burden, and preventing complications. Antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, and cytoreductive therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g., midostaurin, avapritinib) are key components of therapy, while chemotherapy is reserved for aggressive forms like mast cell leukemia. Bisphosphonates help manage osteoporosis and bone pain, and avoiding triggers such as heat, alcohol, and certain medications is crucial. KIT-negative mastocytosis, as in our case, may require a tailored approach, but the primary goal remains preventing severe reactions and improving quality of life [ Regular monitoring with serum tryptase measurement, organ function assessment, and genetic testing is essential for tracking disease progression [ Mastocytosis is a rare and underdiagnosed disorder characterized by abnormal mast cell accumulation with systemic involvement. The presence of ghost cells may indicate mast cell degranulation and disease progression. Patients with unexplained allergic reactions, bleeding tendencies, or persistent gastrointestinal symptoms should be evaluated. Early recognition and comprehensive diagnostic testing, including bone marrow biopsy, serum tryptase measurement, and KIT mutation analysis, are essential. Diagnosing KIT-negative SM remains challenging, requiring a multimodal approach. Advances in molecular research and diagnostic techniques may improve early detection and guide individualized treatment strategies.",

      "title": "Target bronchus determination in giant emphysematous bullae: A case report",
      "content": "Giant emphysematous bullae (GEB) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cause severe respiratory compromise. While surgical resection is standard, bronchoscopic volume reduction is crucial for surgically ineligible patients. Accurate target bronchus identification remains challenging with conventional imaging. A 67-year-old male with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and right lung GEB presented with severe dyspnea (modified Medical Research Council score 4), hypercapnia (partial pressure of carbon dioxide: 45 mm Hg), and markedly limited exercise tolerance (6-minute walk distance: 62 m). He required home noninvasive ventilation and was deemed unfit for surgery due to critically impaired lung function (Forced expiratory volume in 1 second: 0.36 L, 12.2% predicted). Preoperative high-resolution computed tomography (CT) and 3D reconstruction localized the target bronchus to the right middle lobe. However, percutaneous aspiration and drug injection via drainage tube revealed misalignment, prompting reidentification of the target bronchus in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe. CT-guided percutaneous GEB volume reduction was performed, involving air extraction and intrabullous injection of erythromycin lactobionate. Subsequent selective bronchial occlusion of the posterior right upper lobe segment via bronchoscopic autologous blood and thrombin injection was conducted. Continuous negative-pressure drainage was maintained post-procedure. Follow-up CT at 6 months confirmed complete GEB closure. Dyspnea improved significantly (modified Medical Research Council score 3), exercise capacity increased (6-minute walk distance: 220 m), and ventilator use was discontinued. No complications or recurrence were observed during follow-up. Percutaneous aspiration and drug injection refine target bronchus identification when imaging yields ambiguous results, enhancing precision for subsequent bronchoscopic interventions. This strategy minimizes reliance on endobronchial valves, reducing costs and procedural complexity. Larger studies are needed to validate long-term efficacy, but this approach offers a promising minimally invasive alternative for high-risk patients. Bullae refer to thin-walled air sacs in the lungs that exceed 1 cm in diameter and are commonly associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. As the condition progresses, these bullae can evolve into giant emphysematous bullae (GEB), which typically occupy more than one-third of the volume of a hemithorax. Endobronchial valve (EBV) placement has emerged as a widely accepted alternative treatment option. A 67-year-old male patient with a 2-year history of GEB in the right lung and an 11-year history of COPD presented to our department. The patient had been regularly using inhaled medications and required home noninvasive ventilator support owing to the severity of his condition. Prior to our intervention, the patient’s lung function tests revealed a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV Step 1: CT-guided GEB Catheterization. The radiologist analyzed the preoperative HRCT results and identified the target bronchus associated with the GEB in the lateral segment of the right middle lobe (Fig.  Procedure of GEB volume reduction and confirmation of the GEB target bronchus in the Patient. (A, B) Before treatment, GEB occupied the right middle and right lower lungs, and the radiologist evaluated the target bronchus as the lateral segment of the right middle lobe (white arrow). (C) Under the guidance of CT, a central venous catheter was inserted into the GEB, air was pumped through the drainage tube, and medication was injected. The GEB atrophied to the right upper lobe. (D) Drug deposition in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe (black arrow). (E) Anatomical demarcation reveals: right middle lobe (white arrow), right lower lobe (blue arrow), and posterior segment of right upper lobe (black arrow). Drug deposition and drug-related pneumonia are visible in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, with reduced GEB and drainage tubes seen in the surrounding area. (F) Bronchoscopic visualization of the right upper lobe bronchial orifice demonstrates: apical segment (blue arrow), anterior segment (white arrow), and posterior segment (black arrow). Using a 3-chamber lithotomy balloon, autologous blood was injected into the posterior segment of the right upper lobe. (G) Before discharge, CT was reexamined, indicating that the GEB was nearly closed (black arrow). (H) No recurrence of pulmonary bullae was observed during a follow-up examination 6 months after the procedure. CT = computed tomography, GEB = giant emphysematous bullae. Step 2: Erythromycin Lactobionate Injection and Negative-Pressure Drainage. A dose of 1 g erythromycin lactobionate (dissolved in 50 mL of 50% glucose) was injected into GEB through the central venous catheter. The 3-way connector was closed immediately after injection, and CT imaging was performed 10 minutes later to observe drug deposition patterns and assess for delayed pneumothorax. Post-procedure, the patient underwent continuous ECG monitoring and vital sign surveillance. Follow-up CT revealed contraction of the GEB toward the right upper lobe, with drug deposition localized to the posterior segment of the right upper lobe (Fig.  Step 3: Bronchoscopic Selective Bronchial Occlusion. Five days after the GEB puncture, we inserted a 3-chamber lithotomy balloon via bronchoscopy into the posterior segment of the right upper lobe (Fig.  Six-month follow-up CT confirmed complete GEB closure (Fig.  Comparison of lung function, blood gas analysis, dyspnea, and quality of life scores in GEB patients before surgery, before discharge and 6 months after surgery. %pred = %predicted, 6MWT = 6-minute walking testing, FEV The pathogenesis of GEB is closely associated with the progression of COPD. Core mechanisms include smoking, α1-antitrypsin deficiency, intravenous drug use, cannabis and cocaine consumption, sarcoidosis, and autoimmune disorders. Patients with GEB typically do not respond to medical treatment, making surgical removal the preferred option because of its potential to significantly improve lung function and exercise tolerance. Bronchoscopic and percutaneous GEB volume-reduction techniques have emerged as standard alternative treatments for patients with GEB who are ineligible for surgery. Selecting the correct segmental bronchus for EBV placement in giant emphysematous bullae GEB can be challenging. Conventional imaging techniques, such as high-resolution HRCT and 3D reconstruction, are often used to identify the target bronchus. However, the compression and distortion of adjacent bronchial structures by GEB may obscure anatomical relationships, leading to misidentification of the target bronchus, as demonstrated in our case, where initial HRCT localization discrepancies were corrected via percutaneous aspiration and drug injection, although such cases are relatively rare. Additionally, GEB may alter bronchial orientation or collapse aerated pathways, complicating preoperative planning. Advanced navigation tools (e.g., electromagnetic or virtual bronchoscopy) may improve accuracy, but their efficacy in GEB cases remains understudied. Meta-analytical evidence indicates that the success of EBV therapy is highly dependent on achieving complete isolation of the target lung region. As indicated by relevant studies, Takizawa et al When the patient was in the supine position, the erythromycin lactobionate solution injected into GEB via the drainage tube indeed tended to deposit dorsally due to gravitational effects. To address this, air extraction via the drainage tube was performed to rapidly reduce the GEB volume, causing the bulla to collapse toward its base. Following drug injection through the drainage tube, the majority of the drug deposits in the dorsal region of the GEB, while a small portion may accumulate at the bulla base and subsequently enter the lung parenchyma via the target bronchus (especially after positional changes), potentially causing drug-related pneumonia. In this case, after catheterization and aspiration of the GEB, the bulla shrank toward the right upper lobe, preliminarily localizing the target bronchus to the right upper lobe. Post-injection imaging confirmed drug deposition exclusively in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe. A follow-up CT scan 4 days later revealed that the reduced GEB remained localized to the right upper lung, with drug-related pneumonia observed only in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe (Fig.  The use of bronchoscopic autologous blood injection for GEB volume reduction has been preliminarily explored in previous studies. For instance, case reports Furthermore, in contrast to bronchoscopic EBV placement, percutaneous bulla reduction demonstrates significant cost-effectiveness. Data from recent studies indicate that EBV placement imposes substantial economic strain, as each GEB patient typically requires implantation of 3 valves on average, This case report highlights the efficacy of a combined percutaneous and bronchoscopic approach for volume reduction in surgically ineligible patients with GEB. By integrating CT-guided aspiration, intrabullous sclerotherapy, and selective bronchial occlusion, this minimally invasive strategy achieved complete GEB closure, significant symptomatic improvement, and functional recovery in a high-risk patient with severe COPD. Notably, the use of percutaneous drug injection and aspiration proved instrumental in refining target bronchus identification when conventional imaging yielded ambiguous results, thereby enhancing procedural precision. Despite these promising results, the study is limited by its single-case design and short-term follow-up. Larger prospective studies are warranted to validate long-term efficacy, optimize technical protocols, and identify patient subgroups most likely to benefit.",

      "title": "Penehyclidine combined with antiemetics for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting: A meta-analysis of randomized control trials and trial sequential analysis",
      "content": "Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is one of the most common adverse complications associated with anesthesia and after surgical procedures. PONV is related to patient dissatisfaction and can lead to several postoperative complications. This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of penehyclidine combined with antiemetics in preventing PONV. We searched English databases (including PubMed, Web of Science, Ovid Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library), Chinese electronic databases (including China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, VIP, and Chinese Biomedical Literature) and trial registry databases to find randomized controlled trials researching the clinical validity of penehyclidine combined with antiemetics for PONV. The retrieval time was up to January 2025, without publication date restrictions. Articles published in the English and Chinese languages were considered. The primary outcome was the incidence of PONV within and over 24 hours postoperatively. The secondary outcomes were the incidence of different severities of PONV, incidence of postoperative rescue antiemetic therapy and postoperative complications. Quality assessment was conducted with the Cochrane Collaboration’s risk of bias tool and grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation method. Subgroup analyses were performed according to the postoperative observation period. Trial sequential analysis was performed to validate the reliability of the primary outcome. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plots and Egger’s regression test. Sixteen randomized controlled trials comprising 1561 participants were included. Compared with the control group, penehyclidine combined with antiemetics provided a lower incidence of PONV (risk ratio [RR]: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.57–0.74;  Compared with antiemetics, penehyclidine combined with antiemetics could provide better prevention efficiency for PONV, with lower incidence of PONV, lower incidence of severe PONV over 24 hours postoperatively and lower incidence of postoperative rescue antiemetic therapy. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) defined as any nausea, and vomiting within the first 24 to 48 hours after surgery in inpatients, is one of the most common adverse complications associated with anesthesia and surgical procedures, and is strongly related to patient dissatisfaction. Combination therapy involving 2 or more antiemetics that act on different receptors for the prevention of PONV has been recommended by the Consensus Guidelines for the Management of PONV as a risk-based approach to PONV prophylaxis. In recent years, progress has been made in the combination with antiemetic drugs, and anticholinergics have been used to reduce the incidence of PONV. Recent clinical studies have shown that penehyclidine for the prevention of PONV has made good progress in some surgical procedures, such as ophthalmology, laparoscopic bariatric surgery, gynecological laparoscopic surgery, thyroid surgery and stomatology surgery. This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions. The PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Ovid Medline, Embase and Chinese databases (including the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang database, VIP databases and Chinese Biomedical Literature) were searched from inception to January 2025 to identify randomized controlled studies of participants who received penehyclidine combined with antiemetics for PONV. The search keywords were as follows: (penehyclidine) AND ([postoperative nausea and vomiting] OR [PONV]). The search terms were translated into Chinese for study identification in Chinese databases. In addition, the list of references, relevant conference literature, and trial registry databases (WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Clinical Trials.gov, and Chinese Clinical Trials Registry) were scrutinized to identify additional studies. The preliminary search strategy and the details of the search process used for each database are given in Appendix 1, Supplemental Digital Content,  Studies were selected via the PICOS strategy (participants, interventions, comparators, outcomes, and study designs). The inclusion criteria for the studies included in this meta-analysis were as follows: Participants: Patients who underwent surgery under general anesthesia; Types of interventions: Penehyclidine combined with different antiemetic drugs used for PONV (Penehyclidine + Antiemetics group); Types of comparators: Antiemetic drugs other than penehyclidine for PONV (Antiemetics group); Types of outcomes: The primary outcome: The incidence of PONV within and over 24 hours postoperatively. PONV was defined as follows: (1) The development of any nausea, retching, or vomiting after surgery. (2) At least 1 episode of nausea or vomiting or a combination of both symptoms. (3) At least 1 episode of nausea, vomiting, retching, or any combination of these symptoms. The secondary outcomes were as follows: (1) Incidence of different severities of PONV: defined as the ratio of the number of patients who evaluated to the corresponding severity of PONV. The severity of PONV was evaluated as follows: (1) Mild PONV: occurrence of mild nausea or 1 episode of vomiting (2) Moderate PONV: moderate-to-severe nausea, or vomiting for 2 times or more, or any nausea that required only one rescue antiemetic therapy (3) Severe PONV: more than 2 emetic episodes or necessitating more than 1 dose of rescue antiemetics Incidence of postoperative rescue antiemetic therapy: defined as the ratio of the number of patients who had received antiemetics (regardless of how many times the patient had received it) divided by the total number of patients. Incidence of postoperative complications: included dry mouth and other anticholinergic-related complications (including headache; dizziness; fever, defined as a temperature >37.5°C; and urinary retention, defined as required urine recatheterization). Exploratory outcomes (1) Incidence of postoperative nausea (PON): PON is defined as a subjective sensation of an unpleasant feeling associated with an awareness of wanting to vomit. (2) Incidence of postoperative vomiting (POV): POV is defined as the forceful expulsion of gastric contents through the mouth, or dry-retching, and was assessed by the patient’s response of yes or no to questioning. Types of studies: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English or Chinese were included. Studies with the following situations were excluded: studies that only compared the effectiveness of monotherapy with penehyclidine for PONV; studies without randomization for treatment; studies whose data could not be extracted for statistical analysis; and duplicate publications, editorials, letters, abstracts from conferences, reviews, and ongoing trials. Two authors (Hongwei Zhang and Jianqiao Zheng) were required to screen the retrieved studies independently. Briefly, all titles and abstracts identified in the search were carefully examined, duplicate studies and those that did not match the inclusion criteria were excluded. The same 2 authors (Hongwei Zhang and Jianqiao Zheng) read the full text of each remaining study to select any potentially relevant articles. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion and the involvement of a third reviewer (Lu Zhang). A fourth author (Li Du) checked all procedures before approving the data extraction. Two authors (Hongwei Zhang and Jianqiao Zheng) independently extracted data from the included studies following a data acquisition Excel form (Excel version 2013, Microsoft Inc., Washington). The form included the first author’s name, publication year, participants’ demographic data (age, gender, BMI, American Society of Anesthesiologist classification), sample size, detailed information on general anesthesia management (including anesthesia induction and maintenance), detailed information on the prevention of PONV (including type of antiemetics, administration time and dose of penehyclidine and antiemetics) and outcomes. A third reviewer (Li Du) was required to double-check the data to ensure consistency. We attempted to contact the corresponding author by email to obtain the original data when the information and data were missing or incomplete in any study. Useful numerical data in the graphs were extrapolated by Adobe Photoshop, if necessary and feasible. The characteristics of the included studies.

CI = 95% confidence interval, GRADE = Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation, PON = postoperative nausea, PONV = postoperative nausea and vomiting, POV = postoperative vomiting, RR = rate ratio. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that penehyclidine combined with antiemetics provided a lower incidence of PONV within and over 24 hours postoperatively, lower incidence of severe PONV over 24 hours postoperatively, and a lower incidence of postoperative rescue antiemetic therapy. However, it was associated with a higher incidence of dry mouth, but did not increase the incidence of other anticholinergic-related complications. Penehyclidine combined with antiemetics resulted in a lower incidence of PONV both within and over 24 hours postoperatively. We speculated that the following reasons may be responsible. First, penehyclidine may reduce the vagal reflex, which may inhibit vagal afferent activation by acting on M1-type receptors to mitigate PONV. Second, penehyclidine can relieve gastrointestinal smooth muscle spasms by acting on M3 cholinergic receptors in the digestive glands and smooth muscle of the digestive tract, which is effective in reducing postoperative gastric intraluminal pressure. Third, penehyclidine postconditioning could improve small intestinal mucosal injury and reduce damage to the barrier function of the small intestinal mucosa caused by limb ischemia-reperfusion. In addition, the elimination half-life of penehyclidine is approximately 24 hours, causing its preventive effect on PONV to diminish or disappear after 24 hours. Dry mouth symptoms were observed in 117 individuals (57.64%) in the Penehyclidine + Antiemetics group, which was significantly higher than that in the Antiemetics group (38 individuals; 18.63%). This could be attributed to its impact on type 3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, leading to reduced glandular secretion from respiratory submucosal glands. As a novel anticholinergic and highly selective antagonist of both type 3 and type 1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, penehyclidine has fewer adverse effects than other anticholinergics. No significant differences were found between the 2 groups regarding other anticholinergic-related side effects, such as headache, dizziness, fever or urinary retention. Delayed recovery of intestinal function and postoperative delirium (POD) are major concerns in the use of anticholinergic drugs. We also investigated the efficacy of penehyclidine combined with routine antiemetics in preventing PON and POV separately. Our meta-analysis revealed that, compared with monotherapy with antiemetics alone, penehyclidine combined with antiemetics provided a lower incidence of PON and POV. However, few trials have contributed data to the subgroup analysis of the incidence of PON and POV, indicating that subgroup analysis may not be able to detect the advantages of penehyclidine combined with antiemetics because of the insufficient sample size. Moreover, penehyclidine could play a role in preventing PONV by blocking both the type 1 and type 3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which play important roles in the pathogenesis of PONV. The risk factors for PONV included female sex, inhaled anesthesia for >60 minutes, high-risk procedures (cholecystectomy, laparoscopic, gynecologic), and age < 50 years. For the primary outcome, TSA was performed to test the validity, and publication bias was assessed to assess the stability. In addition, GRADE was performed to test the quality evidence of all the outcomes. The TSA of the pooled meta-analysis revealed strong evidence that penehyclidine combined with antiemetics provided a lower incidence of PONV within 24 hours postoperatively, and that evidence for the incidence of PONV over 24 hours postoperatively was uncertain. Significant publication bias was indicated, and trim-and-fill analysis was performed to reduce and adjust for publication bias. Fortunately, the correction for potential publication bias did not materially alter the stability of the results. The results of the GRADE analysis indicated that the evidence quality of the outcomes was low to very low, indicating that the clinical value of penehyclidine combined with antiemetics in preventing PONV is limited. Therefore, more RCTs are required in the future to improve the evidence quality of the results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis pooling and analyzing the efficacy and safety of penehyclidine combined with antiemetics for PONV. For the primary outcome, TSA was performed to test the validity, and publication bias was assessed by visual judgment of the funnel plot asymmetry, Egger’s regression test, and trim-and-fill analysis to check the stability of the primary outcome. In addition, GRADE was performed to test the evidence quality of all the outcomes. There are also limitations to our analysis. First, the number of studies with eligible data was limited, and the sample size of each included study was small. Potential heterogeneity could exist, which could result in inadequate statistical power for the outcomes. Therefore, TSA was performed as an additional statistical analysis for the primary outcome. Second, potential clinical and methodological heterogeneity related to the patient population, type of surgery, anesthesia maintenance method, different antiemetics, and different administration times, which could influence the outcomes. Third, the pooled results were supported by a low or very low quality of evidence according to GRADE. Therefore, the clinical value of the results is limited. Therefore, future RCTs with larger sample sizes, clinical consistency, and methodological consistency are required to confirm our findings. Based on current published evidence, compared with antiemetics, penehyclidine combined with antiemetics provides better prevention efficiency for PONV by decreasing the incidence of PONV (a lower incidence of PON and a lower incidence of POV) and severe PONV over 24 hours postoperatively. Penehyclidine combined with antiemetics is associated with a higher incidence of dry mouth, whereas the incidence of other anticholinergic-related complications is not different. These findings may provide a new prevention therapy for PONV. Further RCTs with larger sample sizes, consistent clinical assessments, and methodological consistency are required to improve our understanding of the subject.",

      "title": "Functional ambulation recovery in MCA stroke survivors: Predictive role of cognitive function and extremely low alanine aminotransferase levels: A retrospective observational study",
      "content": "Stroke is a leading cause of disability, significantly impacting mobility. Effective rehabilitation depends on accurate predictors of recovery. Recent studies suggest that both cognitive function and certain initial laboratory biomarkers, such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), could be crucial for predicting recovery outcomes. This study investigates how cognitive function and ALT levels can predict functional ambulation in survivors of middle cerebral artery stroke. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 87 patients who began rehabilitation within 30 days of their first middle cerebral artery stroke. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to identify predictors of ambulation recovery. The variables assessed included age, sex, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Berg Balance Scale, Mini-Mental State Examination, and extremely low ALT levels. Multivariate binary logistic regression revealed that female sex, lower Mini-Mental State Examination and Berg Balance Scale scores, and extremely low ALT levels were associated with poorer odds of achieving functional ambulation. This research underscores the critical role of integrating cognitive assessments and routine biomarkers into rehabilitation practices to enhance prognostic accuracy and personalize rehabilitation strategies. The findings highlight the need for further investigation to confirm these results and explore the underlying mechanisms, with the aim of advancing individualized rehabilitation approaches and improving patient outcomes. Stroke has a high prevalence worldwide and is a major health issue, with millions of people suffering from disabilities each year. Previous studies have highlighted several factors associated with functional mobility in stroke patients, including stroke type, age, sex, initial stroke severity as measured by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), cognitive function, and motor function of the lower extremities. Cognitive function has a significant impact on the rehabilitation and functional recovery of stroke patients. Another factor that may have a significant impact on functional recovery after stroke is frailty. If frailty can be detected early through routine testing, it would be beneficial to have a precise, individualized rehabilitation plan. There is a substantial body of research that suggests that extremely low ALT levels found on routine testing are associated with frailty and sarcopenia, and even mortality in the elderly following physical stress. Middle cerebral artery (MCA) strokes, which affect specific brain regions, frequently result in substantial impairment of hand function due to the localization of the lesion. Despite this potential for ambulation recovery, a significant number of patients still fail to achieve functional ambulation within the short-term rehabilitation period. This can be attributed to various factors, including the severity of the initial stroke, the presence of cognitive impairments, and other underlying health conditions. The necessity for extended rehabilitation highlights the importance of identifying precise predictors of ambulation recovery to tailor rehabilitation programs more effectively and enhance patient outcomes. The objective of this study is to enhance the precision of prognostic assessments for functional ambulation recovery in MCA stroke survivors by evaluating the predictive value of cognitive function and extremely low levels of ALT. By integrating these indicators, the research aims to provide actionable insights that can guide personalized rehabilitation strategies and improve recovery outcomes, addressing a critical gap in current stroke rehabilitation practices. This retrospective medical record review study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of a university-affiliated hospital. Given its retrospective nature, the need for written informed consent was waived. This research was conducted using a retrospective analysis of electronically documented medical records, employing data derived from routine clinical evaluations and assessments performed during standard care protocols. The Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC) tool was utilized as the primary criterion for assessing ambulation, ensuring consistent evaluation across different studies and enhancing the comparability and reliability of results. Balance, encompassing both fundamental lower limb motor functions and proprioceptive aspects, was identified as a critical body function for functional ambulation. Thus, the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) was chosen as a key predictor due to its comprehensive assessment of balance, which is essential for evaluating functional ambulation outcomes. Cognitive function, which has been widely studied for its influence on post-stroke recovery of walking ability, was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Regarding the inclusion of laboratory findings, routine blood tests conducted during the acute phase of stroke were retrospectively collected and analyzed for their prognostic significance. This approach focused on blood test results from the time of stroke onset to identify biomarkers that could influence clinical outcomes and prognosis. Creatinine was included due to its well-documented association with functional outcomes post-stroke, serving as a covariate to adjust for its prognostic influence. This retrospective chart review study was performed in line with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Approval was granted by the Institutional Review Board of the Catholic Kwandong University International St Mary’s Hospital (Institutional Review Board No. IS24RISI0006, 2024). Given its retrospective nature and use of de-identified medical records, the requirement for written informed consent was waived. A retrospective medical record review study conducted at a university-affiliated hospital from June 2016 to June 2023. Patients who were diagnosed with a first stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), transferred to a rehabilitation department, and started rehabilitation within 30 days of their first stroke were defined as initial subacute stroke patients and were included in the study. This study focused only on subjects with hemiplegic MCA stroke who were not initially able to ambulate. Patients were excluded from the study if they (1) had musculoskeletal disorders that could influence their gait; (2) presented with quadriplegia due to bilateral brain involvement; (3) had a concurrent stroke in regions other than the MCA; (4) had liver disease or an ALT level exceeding 40 U/L; or (5) could ambulate functionally from the initial assessment, including those with a FAC scale of 3 or higher. A total of 87 subjects were included in the retrospective analysis. The primary outcome was whether functional ambulation was achieved after short-term (1–2 months) subacute rehabilitation assessed using FAC. The FAC scale evaluates ambulation ability, with scales defined as follows: FAC 0 indicates non-ambulatory status; FAC 1 requires assistance for a few steps; FAC 2 allows independent walking for short distances but needs help for longer distances or uneven surfaces; FAC 3 signifies independent ambulation on flat surfaces, with possible assistance needed for stairs; FAC 4 denotes independent walking in all situations, including stairs and uneven terrain; and FAC 5 represents full independence in any environment. Among the covariates, basic clinical data included age, sex, and comorbidities. The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was used as a covariate to adjust for the impact of comorbidities on post-stroke ambulation function recovery. Among the covariates, clinical indicators related to stroke were investigated as type of stroke (hemorrhagic or ischemic) and location of brain lesion (left or right), initial NIHSS as the initial severity of the stroke. The BBS is a clinical assessment tool with a maximum score of 56, with higher scores indicating better balance ability. Routine laboratory biomarkers included as covariates were creatinine for renal function, albumin and hemoglobin for nutritional status, ALT for its potential link to frailty. We specifically focused on initial cognitive function, balance ability, and extremely low ALT levels as key covariates in predicting functional ambulation acquisition. To assess these predictors, we converted them into binary variables for a binary logistic regression model. The MMSE was categorized into low (below 20) and high (20 and above) groups based on prior research indicating differing outcomes. We conducted statistical analyses using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Subjects were divided into a group that achieved functional ambulation after subacute rehabilitation following MCA stroke and a group that remained unable to walk at the time of discharge (approximately 1–2 months post-rehabilitation). Normality was assessed using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Differences between groups were compared using independent  To identify predictors of functional ambulation acquisition, binary logistic regression was employed, conducting both univariate and multivariate analyses. The multivariate analysis utilized the backward stepwise (conditional) method to include multiple covariates and identify statistically significant predictors, adjusting for potential confounders The significance level was set at  The average age of individuals who did not achieve functional ambulation was significantly higher at 69.4 ± 13.2 years compared to 61.2 ± 11.5 years for those who did ( General characteristics and functional ambulation after subacute rehabilitation.

In summary, this study investigated factors affecting functional ambulation after subacute rehabilitation in stroke patients. The key findings indicate that sex, age, initial MMSE, serum hemoglobin, albumin, extremely low-level serum ALT, CCI, and initial BBS were significantly associated with functional ambulation outcomes. Multivariate analysis revealed that being male, younger, having higher serum hemoglobin, higher MMSE, and higher initial BBS scores predicted better ambulation outcomes. Additionally, patients with extremely low-level serum ALT were less likely to achieve functional ambulation compared to those with ALT levels within the normal reference range. This study aimed to elucidate the determinants of functional ambulation in stroke patients undergoing subacute rehabilitation, addressing a critical gap in understanding recovery trajectories. Stroke remains a leading cause of long-term disability, with functional mobility being a key determinant of patient independence and quality of life. Identifying predictive factors for successful rehabilitation outcomes is thus essential. The research was guided by the hypothesis that a multifactorial approach, incorporating clinical, cognitive, and biochemical parameters, such as initial NIHSS scores, serum hemoglobin, extremely low-level ALT, MMSE scores, and BBS scores, would yield robust predictors of functional ambulation. The findings substantiated this hypothesis, revealing significant associations between better ambulation and variables such as younger age, male sex, higher serum hemoglobin, and superior cognitive and balance function, while extremely low serum ALT levels were linked to poorer outcomes. The integration of routinely measured laboratory biomarkers into this analysis enhances its clinical relevance, as these markers are readily available at the time of stroke diagnosis. For instance, ALT and albumin levels, although traditionally associated with liver function and nutritional status respectively, may also reflect broader systemic conditions like frailty, sarcopenia, and overall physical resilience, which are critical in the context of stroke recovery. The relevance of ALT, particularly its association with frailty, disability, and adverse outcomes, extends beyond traditional hepatic concerns. Low ALT levels have emerged in recent literature as markers of frailty and poor survival in elderly populations. Routine laboratory biomarkers were included in this analysis due to their potential clinical utility in prognosis. Some biomarkers that are routinely measured during initial blood tests, if found to be linked to outcomes, could greatly enhance clinical decision-making. The results in Table  Regarding ALT, although no significant differences were observed when treated as a continuous variable, categorizing ALT levels revealed notable differences, underscoring the relevance of extremely low ALT levels in frailty and recovery prediction. Hemoglobin and albumin levels, indicators of nutritional status, were also significant, consistent with other studies that link good nutritional status to better functional recovery. The multivariate logistic regression analysis in Table  Considering these findings, the clinical implications of this study are significant. The inclusion of routinely measured biomarkers like ALT and albumin in the initial evaluation of stroke patients could enhance prognostic accuracy and guide tailored intervention strategies. Specifically, early identification of patients with extremely low ALT levels or low albumin could prompt more intensive frailty management and personalized rehabilitation plans. By recognizing these indicators as predictors rather than treatment targets, clinicians can better anticipate challenges in recovery and optimize resource allocation. Moreover, this study highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to stroke rehabilitation. The integration of cognitive rehabilitation, frailty management, and physical therapy is vital in addressing the diverse needs of stroke patients. Frailty management emerges as a key area of focus, given its close association with poor recovery outcomes. The findings also open avenues for future research. Larger, multicenter studies are needed to validate these results and explore additional biomarkers that could refine prognostic models. Moreover, prospective studies should investigate the longitudinal impact of these predictors on long-term outcomes, helping to identify optimal intervention windows and strategies. Further exploration of the mechanisms linking low ALT levels to frailty and recovery could also yield novel therapeutic targets, offering new directions for enhancing rehabilitation outcomes. This study has several limitations, including a relatively small sample size and the retrospective nature of the analysis, which may introduce selection bias. Another important limitation is the potential ambiguity in interpreting low ALT levels. While extremely low ALT is associated with frailty, it may also reflect other unmeasured confounders such as undiagnosed liver disease or variations in muscle mass. These factors could contribute to outcome differences and warrant careful consideration in interpreting our findings. Additionally, the study population was limited to patients from a single institution, which may affect the generalizability of the findings. Future studies should include prospective validation in larger, multicenter cohorts to confirm these associations and explore the potential dose–response relationship between continuous ALT levels and rehabilitation outcomes. Furthermore, targeted frailty interventions in patients with low ALT levels should be investigated to assess whether such approaches can enhance functional ambulation recovery. In conclusion, this study offers a comprehensive analysis of factors influencing functional ambulation in stroke patients undergoing subacute rehabilitation. By integrating clinical evaluations, cognitive assessments, and initial biochemical markers, particularly focusing on extremely low levels of ALT, the research provides a robust framework for understanding recovery mechanisms. The findings emphasize the critical role of cognitive and physical evaluations alongside baseline serum biomarkers, with extremely low ALT levels emerging as a significant predictor of rehabilitation outcomes. This study advances theoretical knowledge and supports the implementation of personalized rehabilitation strategies aligned with precision medicine principles. Future research should focus on further refining these prognostic indicators, especially the role of extremely low ALT levels, and explore additional variables to enhance predictive accuracy, thereby advancing both theoretical insights and clinical applications in stroke rehabilitation.",

      "title": "WHO Health Topic: Diabetes",
      "content": "Overview Diabetes is a chronic, metabolic disease characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose (or blood sugar), which leads over time to serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves. The most common is type 2 diabetes, usually in adults, which occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't make enough insulin. In the past 3 decades the prevalence of type 2 diabetes has risen dramatically in countries of all income levels. Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin by itself. For people living with diabetes, access to affordable treatment, including insulin, is critical to their survival. There is a globally agreed target to halt the rise in diabetes and obesity by 2025.About 830 million people worldwide have diabetes, the majority living in low-and middle-income countries. More than half of people living with diabetes are not receiving treatment. Both the number of people with diabetes and the number of people with untreated diabetes have been steadily increasing over the past decades. Symptoms test Symptoms of type 1 diabetes include the need to urinate often, thirst, constant hunger, weight loss, vision changes and fatigue. These symptoms may occur suddenly. Symptoms for type 2 diabetes are generally similar to those of type 1 diabetes but are often less marked. As a result, the disease may be diagnosed several years after onset, after complications have already arisen. For this reason, it is important to be aware of risk factors. Prevention and treatment test Type 1 diabetes cannot currently be prevented. Effective approaches are available to prevent type 2 diabetes and to prevent the complications and premature death that can result from all types of diabetes. These include policies and practices across whole populations and within specific settings (school, home, workplace) that contribute to good health for everyone, regardless of whether they have diabetes, such as exercising regularly, eating healthily, avoiding smoking, and controlling blood pressure and lipids. The starting point for living well with diabetes is an early diagnosis – the longer a person lives with undiagnosed and untreated diabetes, the worse their health outcomes are likely to be. Easy access to basic diagnostics, such as blood glucose testing, should therefore be available in primary health care settings. Patients will need periodic specialist assessment or treatment for complications. A series of cost-effective interventions can improve patient outcomes, regardless of what type of diabetes they may have. These interventions include blood glucose control through a combination of diet, physical activity and, if necessary, medication; control of blood pressure and lipids to reduce cardiovascular risk and other complications; and regular screening for damage to the eyes, kidneys and feet to facilitate early treatment.

      "title": "WHO Health Topic: Cardiovascular Diseases",
      "content": "Overview Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year. CVDs are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions. More than four out of five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age.The most important behavioural risk factors of heart disease and stroke are unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol. Amongst environmental risk factors, air pollution is an important factor. The effects of behavioural risk factors may show up in individuals as raised blood pressure, raised blood glucose, raised blood lipids, and overweight and obesity. These “intermediate risks factors” can be measured in primary care facilities and indicate an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure and other complications.Cessation of tobacco use, reduction of salt in the diet, eating more fruit and vegetables, regular physical activity and avoiding harmful use of alcohol have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Health policies that create conducive environments for making healthy choices affordable and available, as well as improving air quality and reducing pollution, are essential for motivating people to adopt and sustain healthy behaviours.Identifying those at highest risk of CVDs and ensuring they receive appropriate treatment can prevent premature deaths. Access to noncommunicable disease medicines and basic health technologies in all primary health care facilities is essential to ensure that those in need receive treatment and counselling. Symptoms Heart attack and strokeOften, there are no symptoms of the underlying disease of the blood vessels. A heart attack or stroke may be the first sign of underlying disease. Symptoms of a heart attack include:pain or discomfort in the centre of the chest; and/orpain or discomfort in the arms, the left shoulder, elbows, jaw, or back.In addition the person may experience difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath; nausea or vomiting; light-headedness or faintness; a cold sweat; and turning pale. Women are more likely than men to have shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, and back or jaw pain.The most common symptom of a stroke is sudden weakness of the face, arm, or leg, most often on one side of the body. Other symptoms include sudden onset of:numbness of the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body;confusion, difficulty speaking or understanding speech;difficulty seeing with one or both eyes;difficulty walking, dizziness and/or loss of balance or coordination;severe headache with no known cause; and/orfainting or unconsciousness.People experiencing these symptoms should seek medical care immediately.Rheumatic heart diseaseSymptoms of rheumatic heart disease include: shortness of breath, fatigue, irregular heartbeats, chest pain and fainting. Symptoms of rheumatic fever (which can cause rheumatic heart disease if not treated) include: fever, pain and swelling of the joints, nausea, stomach cramps and vomiting. Treatment WHO supports governments to prevent, manage and monitor CVDs by developing global strategies to reduce the incidence, morbidity and mortality of these diseases. These strategies include reducing risk factors, developing standards of care, enhancing health system capacity to care for patients with CVD, and monitoring disease patterns and trends to inform national and global actions.The risk factors for CVD include behaviours such as tobacco use, an unhealthy diet, harmful use of alcohol and inadequate physical activity. They also include physiological factors, including high blood pressure (hypertension), high blood cholesterol and high blood sugar or glucose, which are linked to underlying social determinants and drivers such as ageing, income and urbanization.

      "title": "WHO Health Topic: Cancer",
      "content": "Overview Cancer is a large group of diseases that can start in almost any organ or tissue of the body when abnormal cells grow uncontrollably, go beyond their usual boundaries to invade adjoining parts of the body and/or spread to other organs. The latter process is called metastasizing and is a major cause of death from cancer. A neoplasm and malignant tumour are other common names for cancer.Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, accounting for an estimated 9.6 million deaths, or 1 in 6 deaths, in 2018. Lung, prostate, colorectal, stomach and liver cancer are the most common types of cancer in men, while breast, colorectal, lung, cervical and thyroid cancer are the most common among women.The cancer burden continues to grow globally, exerting tremendous physical, emotional and financial strain on individuals, families, communities and health systems. Many health systems in low- and middle-income countries are least prepared to manage this burden, and large numbers of cancer patients globally do not have access to timely quality diagnosis and treatment. In countries where health systems are strong, survival rates of many types of cancers are improving thanks to accessible early detection, quality treatment and survivorship care. Prevention Between 30% and 50% of cancer deaths could be prevented by modifying or avoiding key risk factors and implementing existing evidence-based prevention strategies. The cancer burden can also be reduced through early detection of cancer and management of patients who develop cancer. Prevention also offers the most cost-effective long-term strategy for the control of cancer.Modifying or avoiding the following key risk factors can help prevent cancer:avoid tobacco use, including cigarettes and smokeless tobacco;maintain a healthy weight;eat a healthy diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables;exercise regularly;limit alcohol use;practice safe sex; get vaccinated against hepatitis B and human papillomavirus (HPV);reduce exposure to ultraviolet radiation;prevent unnecessary ionizing radiation exposure (e.g. minimize occupational exposure, ensure safe and appropriate medical use of radiation in diagnosis and treatment);avoid urban air pollution and indoor smoke from household use of solid fuels;get regular medical care; andsome chronic infections are also risk factors for cancer. People in low- and middle-income countries are more likely to develop cancer through chronic infections. Management Cancer is more likely to respond to effective treatment when identified early, resulting in a greater probability of surviving as well as less morbidity and less expensive treatment. There are two distinct strategies that promote early detection:Early diagnosis identifies symptomatic cancer cases at the earliest possible stage. Screening aims to identify individuals with abnormalities suggestive of a specific cancer or pre-cancer who have not developed any symptoms and refer them promptly for diagnosis and treatment .Treatment options include surgery, cancer medicines and/or radiotherapy, administered alone or in combination. A multidisciplinary team of cancer professionals recommends the best possible treatment plan based on tumour type, cancer stage, clinical and other factors. The choice of treatment should be informed by patients’ preferences and consider the capacity of the health system.Palliative care, which focuses on improving the quality of life of patients and their families, is an essential component of cancer care. Survivorship care includes a detailed plan for monitoring cancer recurrence and detection of new cancers, assessing and managing long-term effects associated with cancer and/or its treatment, and services to ensure that cancer survivor needs are met.

      "title": "WHO Health Topic: Nutrition",
      "content": "Overview Nutrition is a critical part of health and development. Better nutrition is related to improved infant, child and maternal health, stronger immune systems, safer pregnancy and childbirth, lower risk of non-communicable diseases (such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease), and longevity.Healthy children learn better. People with adequate nutrition are more productive and can create opportunities to gradually break the cycles of poverty and hunger.Malnutrition, in every form, presents significant threats to human health. Today the world faces a double burden of malnutrition that includes both undernutrition and overweight, especially in low- and middle-income countries. There are multiple forms of malnutrition, including undernutrition (wasting or stunting), inadequate vitamins or minerals, overweight, obesity, and resulting diet-related noncommunicable diseases.The developmental, economic, social, and medical impacts of the global burden of malnutrition are serious and lasting for individuals and their families, for communities and for countries.Learn about Nutrition and Food Safety and COVID-19 Impact Most recent estimates show that globally, 149.2 million children under the age of 5 years of age are stunted (too short for their age) and 45.4 million are wasted (underweight for their height).  The number of children with stunting is declining in all regions except Africa. Over three-quarters of all children suffering from severe wasting live in Asia.Around 45% of deaths among children under 5 years of age are linked to undernutrition. These mostly occur in low- and middle-income countries. Anaemia is a serious global public health problem that particularly affects young children and pregnant women. WHO estimates that 40% of children less than 5 years of age and 37% of pregnant women worldwide are anaemic. Thirty percent of women of reproductive age have anaemia.Globally, 1.9 billion adults are overweight or obese and 38.9 million children under 5 years of age are overweight. Rates of childhood overweight and obesity are rising, particularly in high-income and upper-middle-income countries.Although breastfeeding protects against undernutrition and overweight, only 44% of infants under 6 months of age are exclusively breastfed.High sodium consumption (>5 g salt/day) contributes to high blood pressure and increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. Most people consume too much salt – on average 9–12 grams per day, or around twice the recommended maximum level of intake. WHO response According to the 2016–2025 nutrition strategy, WHO uses its convening power to help set, align and advocate for priorities and policies that move nutrition forward globally; develops evidence-informed guidance based on robust scientific and ethical frameworks; supports the adoption of guidance and implementation of effective nutrition actions; and monitors and evaluates policy and programme implementation and nutrition outcomes.This work is framed by the Comprehensive implementation plan on maternal, infant, and young child nutrition, adopted by Member States through a World Health Assembly resolution in 2012. Actions to end malnutrition are also vital for achieving the diet-related targets of the Global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013–2020, the Global strategy for women’s, children’s, and adolescent’s health 2016–2030, the report of the Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity (2016), and the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development.In May 2018, the Health Assembly approved the 13th General Programme of Work (GPW13), which guides the work of WHO in 2019–2023. Reduction of salt/sodium intake and elimination of industrially produced trans-fats from the food supply are identified in GPW13 as part of WHO’s priority actions to achieve the aims of ensuring healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.

      "title": "WHO Health Topic: Physical Activity",
      "content": "Overview Regular physical activity is proven to help prevent and manage noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as heart disease, hypertension, stroke, diabetes and several cancers. It also helps to maintain a healthy body weight and can improve mental health, quality of life and well-being. Physical activity refers to all movement. Popular ways to be active include walking, cycling, wheeling, sports, active recreation and play, and can be done at any level of skill and for enjoyment by everybody. Work such as household chores or jobs requiring physical labour is another way to be physically active. Yet, current global estimates show 1 in 3 adults and 81% of adolescents do not do enough physical activity. Furthermore, as countries develop economically, levels of inactivity increase and can be as high as 70% due to changing transport patterns, increased use of technology for work and recreation, cultural values and increasing sedentary behaviour.Sedentary behaviour is periods of low energy expenditure such as sitting and watching TV. Both sedentary behaviour and inadequate levels of physical activity have negative impacts on health systems, the environment, economic development, community and individual well-being and quality of life. Impact Physical inactivity is one of the leading risk factors for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and death worldwide.  Alternately, regular physical activity reduces risk of many types of cancer by 8–28%; heart disease and stroke by 19%; diabetes by 17%, depression and dementia by 28–32%.  It is estimated that 4–5 million deaths per year could be averted if the global population was more active.One in 4 adults and 4 in 5 adolescents don’t do enough physical activity. Women and girls generally are less active than men and boys, widening health inequalities. Older adults and people living with disabilities are also less likely to be active and miss out on the physical, mental and social health benefits. Physical inactivity burdens society through the hidden and growing cost of medical care and loss of productivity.WHO developed an economic analysis which predicts that nearly 500 million new cases of preventable major NCDs will occur globally between 2020 and  2030 if the prevalence of physical inactivity does not change. These NCDs will cost an estimated US $300 billion in healthcare costs alone in that 11 year period, or about US$ 27 billion per year. These estimates do not include the significant indirect costs including loss of productivity. Failing to increase levels of physical activity will negatively impact attainment of global targets as well as multiple SDGs. WHO response In response to the urgent need to address physical inactivity levels worldwide, WHO developed the Global action plan on physical activity 2018–2030 (GAPPA): more active people for a healthier world.WHO supports countries and stakeholders to implement the recommended actions by:setting global policy and guidelines, underpinned by latest evidence and consensus, which are developed to help countries develop appropriate policies, investment cases and financing mechanisms to increase levels of physical activity among all populations; providing global tools and resources including toolkits and training packages to promote key activities, such as walking and cycling; integrating physical activity into primary health care; and innovations using digital platforms to help change behaviours. Capacity building is supported with WHO Academy courses, workshops and other knowledge exchange activities;coordinating and collaborating across sectors including sports, transport, education and environment sectors to provide safe places and opportunities for physical activity for everyone and to inform the development of norms and policy that amplify key messages; and monitoring global progress on implementation of the Global action plan on physical activity through the Global status report, and levels of physical inactivity through instruments such as Global physical activity questionnaire (GPAQ) and the Global school-based student health survey (GSHS).WHO reports to the World Health Assembly on the global progress to increase physical activity by 15% by 2030, and GAPPA milestones of 2026 and 2030.

      "title": "WHO Health Topic: Hypertension",
      "content": "Overview Hypertension, also known as high or raised blood pressure, is a condition in which the blood vessels have persistently raised pressure. Blood is carried from the heart to all parts of the body in the vessels. Each time the heart beats, it pumps blood into the vessels. Blood pressure is created by the force of blood pushing against the walls of blood vessels (arteries) as it is pumped by the heart. The higher the pressure, the harder the heart has to pump. Hypertension is a serious medical condition and can increase the risk of heart, brain, kidney and other diseases. It is a major cause of premature death worldwide, with upwards of 1 in 4 men and 1 in 5 women – over a billion people ­– having the condition. The burden of hypertension is felt disproportionately in low- and middle-income countries, where two thirds of cases are found, largely due to increased risk factors in those populations in recent decades. Symptoms Many people with hypertension do not notice symptoms and may be unaware there is a problem. Symptoms can include early morning headaches, nosebleeds, irregular heart rhythms, vision changes, and buzzing in the ears. More severe forms may exhibit fatigue, nausea, vomiting, confusion, anxiety, chest pain, and muscle tremors. If left untreated, hypertension can cause persistent chest pain (also called angina), heart attacks, heart failure, and an irregular heartbeat, which can lead to a sudden death.  Hypertension can also cause strokes by blocking or bursting arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the brain, as well as kidney damage, which can lead to kidney failure. High blood pressure causes damage to the heart by hardening arteries and decreasing the flood of blood and oxygen to the heart. Detecting hypertension is done with a quick and painless test of blood pressure. This can be done at home, but a health professional can help assess any risks or associated conditions. Treatment Reducing modifiable risk factors is the best way to prevent hypertension and associated diseases of the heart, brain, kidney and other organs. These factors include unhealthy diets (excessive salt consumption, a diet high in saturated fat and trans fats, low intake of fruits and vegetables), physical inactivity, consumption of tobacco and alcohol, and being overweight or obese. Additionally, prolonged exposure to air pollution increases the risk of hypertension in adults.  There are also non-modifiable risk factors, including a family history of hypertension, age over 65 years and co-existing diseases such as diabetes or kidney disease. Avoiding dietary and behavioural risk factors is doubly important for those with unmodifiable or hereditary risk factors.  Hypertension can be managed by reducing and managing mental stress, regularly checking blood pressure and consulting with health professionals, treating high blood pressure and managing other medical conditions. Cessation of tobacco use and the harmful use of alcohol, as well as improvements in diet and exercise, can help reduce symptoms and risk factors from hypertension.

      "title": "WHO Health Topic: Obesity",
      "content": "Overview Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. A body mass index (BMI) over 25 is considered overweight, and over 30 is obese. In 2019, an estimated 5 million noncommunicable disease (NCD) deaths were caused by higher-than-optimal BMI. Rates of overweight and obesity continue to grow in adults and children. From 1990 to 2022, the percentage of children and adolescents aged 5–19 years living with obesity increased four-fold from 2% to 8% globally, while the percentage of adults 18 years of age and older living with obesity more than doubled from 7% to 16%.Obesity is one side of the double burden of malnutrition, and today more people are obese than underweight in every region except the South-East Asia Region. Once considered a problem only in high-income countries, today some middle-income countries have among the highest prevalence of overweight and obesity worldwide. Complications Overweight and obesity are major risk factors for a number of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease and stroke, which are the leading causes of death worldwide. Being overweight can also lead to diabetes and its associated conditions, including blindness, limb amputations, and the need for dialysis. Rates of diabetes have quadrupled since around the world since 1980. Carrying excess weight can lead to musculoskeletal disorders including osteoarthritis. Obesity is also associated with some cancers, including endometrial, breast, ovarian, prostate, liver, gallbladder, kidney and colon. The risk of these noncommunicable diseases increases even when a person is only slightly overweight and grows more serious as the body mass index (BMI) climbs. Obesity in childhood is associated with a wide range of serious health complications and an increased risk of premature onset of related illnesses. Studies have found that without intervention, children and adolescents with obesity will likely continue to be obese into adulthood. Prevention and Control Many of the causes of overweight and obesity are preventable and reversable. Although other factors are involved, the fundamental cause of obesity is an imbalance of calories consumed and calories expended. As global diets have changed in recent decades, there has been an increase in the consumption of energy-dense foods high in fat and free sugars. There has also been a decrease in physical activity due to the changing nature of many types of work, more access to transportation and increased urbanization.Lowering the risk of overweight and obesity includes reducing the number of calories consumed from fats and sugars, increasing the portion of daily intake of fruit, vegetables, legumes, whole grains and nuts, and engaging in regular physical activity (60 minutes per day for children and 150 minutes per week for adults). In babies, studies have shown that exclusive breastfeeding from birth to 6 months of age reduces the risk of infants becoming overweight or obese.

More than 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy; nearly 80% of them live in low- and middle-income countries.An estimated 70% of people with epilepsy could be seizure free if properly diagnosed and treated. However, about three quarters of people with epilepsy in low-income countries do not get the treatment they need, and this rises to 90% in some countries. In many such countries, many health professionals do not have the training to recognize, diagnose and treat epilepsy. In most resource-poor countries, antiseizure medicines are not available.People with epilepsy and their families frequently suffer from stigma and discrimination. In many parts of the world the true nature of epilepsy has also long been distorted by myths, fear and mistaken notions about the disorder.WHO is working with ministries of health and partners to improve access to treatment for epilepsy. Symptoms and treatment Epilepsy is not contagious and is characterized by seizures, which occur because of temporary excessive electric activity in the brain. During seizures, people may lose consciousness or awareness, control of bowel or bladder function, they may not be able to hear or see properly, and their movements may become disturbed. The loss of movement control and sensation can cause injuries from falls. A diagnosis of epilepsy is made by a health professional if there is medical history of at least two seizures. Often this is further confirmed by electroencephalography (EEG), a painless technological method to record and study the electrical activity of the brain.   Treatment for epilepsy can be very effective. With antiseizure medicines, up to 70% of people living with epilepsy could become seizure free. After 2 years of taking medicines without any seizures, a health professional may advise stopping the medicines. Where medicines are not helpful in relieving the condition, some types of surgery can be beneficial. Since people with epilepsy have higher occurrence of psychological conditions such as anxiety and depression, psychosocial help is also useful. WHO response Previous WHO collaborative programmes on epilepsy have shown that integrating epilepsy care in primary health care can significantly reduce the epilepsy treatment gap. Based on the evidence-based methods of the WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP), WHO supports the training of primary care, non-specialist health care providers to diagnose, treat and follow up people with epilepsy. The WHO Programme on Reducing the Epilepsy Treatment Gap combined several innovative strategies to support access and care to services for people with epilepsy, thereby reducing the epilepsy treatment gap. The Programme was implemented in four countries – Ghana, Mozambique, Myanmar and Viet Nam.WHO published Improving the lives of people with epilepsy: a technical brief, which sets out the actions required to deliver an integrated approach to epilepsy care and treatment. This better meets the multifaceted needs of people with epilepsy.

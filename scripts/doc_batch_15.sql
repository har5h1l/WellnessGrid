VALUES ('Severe Anemia With Intraosseous-Intramuscular Hemorrhage in a Patient With Kit-C-Negative Systemic Mastocytosis', 'Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a rare hematologic disorder characterized by clonal proliferation of mast cells in various tissues, often presenting with skin lesions, gastrointestinal symptoms, or anaphylaxis. However, atypical presentations lacking these classical features may delay diagnosis and complicate management. We report the case of a 42-year-old woman who presented with progressive anemia, recurrent spontaneous intramuscular and intraosseous hemorrhages, and severe, unexplained pain. Notably, she lacked cutaneous signs or known allergic triggers. Extensive laboratory and imaging workups ruled out common hematologic and autoimmune causes. Bone marrow biopsy ultimately revealed multifocal clusters of atypical mast cells consistent with SM, despite the absence of the KIT D816V mutation. This case underscores the protean manifestations of SM and the need to maintain a high index of suspicion in patients with unexplained cytopenia and bleeding. It also highlights the role of bone marrow evaluation in the diagnostic pathway, even when classic clinical features are absent. Timely recognition of atypical SM can guide appropriate management and improve patient outcomes. Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a rare hematologic disorder characterized by the clonal proliferation and accumulation of mast cells, i.e., granulated immune cells that play a key role in allergic reactions and innate immunity, in various tissues, including the bone marrow, skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and spleen [ The clinical manifestations of SM are highly heterogeneous, reflecting both the extent of mast cell infiltration in various organs and the systemic effects of mast cell degranulation. Symptoms may range from indolent disease with minimal clinical impact to aggressive subtypes associated with multi-organ dysfunction and poor prognosis [ The absence of KIT mutations in certain cases further complicates diagnosis and underscores the need for heightened clinical suspicion. In patients presenting with unexplained cytopenias, bleeding diathesis, or bone marrow abnormalities, SM should be considered, particularly when other causes have been excluded. A comprehensive diagnostic approach, including bone marrow biopsy with immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry to detect aberrant mast cell markers (e.g., CD25, CD2), measurement of serum tryptase levels, and molecular analysis for KIT and non-KIT mutations, is essential for confirming the diagnosis [ This report aims to explore the hematologic manifestations of SM, with particular attention to mast cell-driven bleeding complications and the diagnostic nuances in KIT-negative cases. By highlighting an atypical presentation, this study emphasizes the importance of recognizing SM as a potential underlying cause of otherwise unexplained hematologic abnormalities. The patient is a 42-year-old female with a past medical history of asthma, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (performed in 2020), and depression who presented with abdominal pain and severe anemia. Initial presentation and diagnostic workup Five months before her diagnosis, the patient developed bilateral ribcage pain and dyspnea, leading to an emergency department (ED) visit, where she was diagnosed with pneumonia and prescribed antibiotics. She later developed left breast bruising and swelling and was treated empirically for soft tissue infection. Around the same time, she experienced persistent low back and buttock pain, unrelieved by steroids, followed by acute left pelvic pain radiating to her thigh, prompting another ED visit. At that time, her hemoglobin had dropped to 5.7 grams per deciliter (g/dL) from a baseline of ~10 g/dL. Abdominal and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without intravenous (IV) contrast showed hepatosplenomegaly and nontraumatic intraosseous and intramuscular hemorrhage in the left iliopsoas and gluteal regions (Figure  The differential diagnosis included infection and noninfectious inflammatory conditions, such as hemorrhagic myonecrosis and hemorrhagic bony infarcts. The patient received three units of packed red blood cells (pRBC) and was empirically treated for infectious myositis. Laboratory findings included a low Immunoglobulin G (IgG) level of 375 milligrams per deciliter (reference range: 767-1590 mg/dL), mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Extensive infectious testing, including blood cultures, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) PCR, hepatitis panel, Lyme immunoglobulin M and G (IgM, IgG), and  Progressive symptoms and hematologic evaluation Two weeks later, the patient was readmitted with hemoptysis and left ear pain. Examination revealed active bleeding in the left middle ear, which was draining through the Eustachian tube into the oropharynx, leading to expectoration of blood. Severe anemia returned with a hemoglobin level of 6 g/dL. She received two units of pPRBCs, after which her hemoglobin stabilized at 8.7 g/dL. A repeat ENT evaluation noted improvement in hemotympanum. MRI of the temporal bones and a CT scan of the neck to assess for paraganglioma; however, the patient declined these studies. The Hematology team was consulted and advised to start intravenous aminocaproic acid, followed by a transition to an oral formulation. However, due to difficulty swallowing large pills, the patient declined the oral medication and was instead switched to tranexamic acid (TXA), which she tolerated well. For discharge planning, Hematology recommended continuing TXA for an additional three days. Given the patient’s occasional complaints of flushing, a tryptase level was obtained and found to be markedly elevated at 1,191 micrograms per liter (mcg/L) (normal range <11 mcg/L), raising suspicion for mastocytosis. Testing for KIT mutation and beta-glucosidases was ordered to assess for mastocytosis and Gaucher’s disease, respectively, both of which can manifest with bleeding, osteonecrosis, and hepatosplenomegaly were negative. The patient was discharged home with close follow-up. The patient returned to the emergency department a week later with chest pain and intermittent, patchy skin rashes along with generalized fatigue. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) chest showed no pulmonary embolism (PE), a slight increase in bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis versus pneumonitis, a new indeterminate inflammatory process in the right chest wall/axilla, and a stable anterior mediastinal nodule. The initial bone marrow biopsy from the previous admission returned and showed significant abnormalities, including extensive necrosis, raising suspicion for mastocytosis. A right axilla biopsy and repeat bone marrow biopsy were done. Axilla biopsy indicated mastocytosis. A concurrent second bone marrow biopsy showed aggregates of necrotic ghost cells, with flow cytometry showing no evidence of lymphoproliferative disorder, acute leukemia, or increased blasts. Cytogenetics revealed a normal karyotype. Additional testing revealed elevated factor VIII level, ferritin, and LDH (Table  Acute pain crisis and confirmation of mastocytosis A few weeks later, while off steroids, the patient underwent a final bone marrow biopsy, which demonstrated a cellular marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis and no increase in blasts, indicating preserved hematopoietic function (Table  Mastocytosis is a rare condition characterized by excessive mast cell accumulation, primarily affecting the skin and bone marrow. Patients with unexplained anaphylaxis, recurrent flushing, chronic skin lesions such as urticaria pigmentosa, or persistently elevated serum tryptase levels should be evaluated for mastocytosis. Additional indications include unexplained cytopenia; osteopenia; chronic gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain; or unexplained bleeding. Individuals with a family history of mast cell disorders, resistant allergic conditions, or multi-organ involvement without a clear etiology should also be considered for further testing [ The World Health Organization (WHO) defines SM based on specific diagnostic criteria, including dense mast cell infiltrates in extracutaneous organs, marrow, or blood, as well as minor criteria such as atypical mast cell morphology, KIT D816V mutations, CD25 expression, and persistently elevated serum tryptase levels. Bone marrow biopsy is essential for detecting these abnormalities and confirming the diagnosis [ Diagnosing SM in patients who lack the KIT D816V mutation is particularly challenging. The KIT D816V mutation is identified in over 80% of SM cases, making it a key diagnostic marker. However, some patients exhibiting clinical and histopathologic features suggestive of SM test negative for this mutation, complicating the diagnostic process [ In KIT D816V-negative SM, the absence of this genetic marker necessitates a more extensive diagnostic approach, incorporating morphology, immunophenotyping, and serum biomarkers. Bone marrow biopsy remains essential, particularly in identifying increased mast cell burden, spindle-shaped mast cells, and aberrant CD25 expression. However, in some cases, mast cell infiltration may be minimal or obscured by extensive fibrosis and necrosis, leading to sampling inconsistencies and potential underdiagnosis [ Flow cytometry can help detect abnormal mast cells, even when histopathology is inconclusive. In addition, elevated serum tryptase levels serve as a useful diagnostic marker but may not always be present, especially in early or indolent SM cases. To further investigate the underlying pathology, next-generation sequencing (NGS) or whole-exome sequencing can identify alternative genetic mutations such as JAK2, TET2, SRSF2, ASXL1, or RUNX1, which are sometimes associated with KIT-negative SM, particularly in advanced or aggressive forms of the disease [ Due to these diagnostic challenges, patients with KIT-negative SM often require multiple bone marrow biopsies and serial assessments over time to reach a definitive diagnosis. Importantly, KIT negativity does not rule out SM, but rather suggests greater molecular and genetic variability, which may influence disease progression and treatment options [ Bleeding in mastocytosis results from multiple factors, including heparin release, platelet dysfunction, coagulopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, and vascular fragility [ A notable finding in this case was the presence of ghost cells in bone marrow, indicative of lysed or degenerated cells. In mastocytosis, these structures suggest mast cell degranulation, leading to the release of histamine, heparin, and other bioactive mediators. This process contributes to tissue damage, fibrosis, and, in advanced cases, bone marrow necrosis [ Management of SM depends on its subtype, symptom severity, and organ involvement, with treatment aimed at controlling symptoms, reducing mast cell burden, and preventing complications. Antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, and cytoreductive therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g., midostaurin, avapritinib) are key components of therapy, while chemotherapy is reserved for aggressive forms like mast cell leukemia. Bisphosphonates help manage osteoporosis and bone pain, and avoiding triggers such as heat, alcohol, and certain medications is crucial. KIT-negative mastocytosis, as in our case, may require a tailored approach, but the primary goal remains preventing severe reactions and improving quality of life [ Regular monitoring with serum tryptase measurement, organ function assessment, and genetic testing is essential for tracking disease progression [ Mastocytosis is a rare and underdiagnosed disorder characterized by abnormal mast cell accumulation with systemic involvement. The presence of ghost cells may indicate mast cell degranulation and disease progression. Patients with unexplained allergic reactions, bleeding tendencies, or persistent gastrointestinal symptoms should be evaluated. Early recognition and comprehensive diagnostic testing, including bone marrow biopsy, serum tryptase measurement, and KIT mutation analysis, are essential. Diagnosing KIT-negative SM remains challenging, requiring a multimodal approach. Advances in molecular research and diagnostic techniques may improve early detection and guide individualized treatment strategies.', 'PubMed_Central', 'asthma_treatment', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/', 'research_article', '{"content_hash": "f66c5d5585321a53", "embedding_date": "2025-06-25T14:21:37.392916", "scraper_source": "PubMed_Central", "category": "research_literature", "subcategory": "pubmed_central", "document_type": "research_article", "published_date": "", "original_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/"}', 12349);

VALUES ('Target bronchus determination in giant emphysematous bullae: A case report', 'Giant emphysematous bullae (GEB) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cause severe respiratory compromise. While surgical resection is standard, bronchoscopic volume reduction is crucial for surgically ineligible patients. Accurate target bronchus identification remains challenging with conventional imaging. A 67-year-old male with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and right lung GEB presented with severe dyspnea (modified Medical Research Council score 4), hypercapnia (partial pressure of carbon dioxide: 45 mm Hg), and markedly limited exercise tolerance (6-minute walk distance: 62 m). He required home noninvasive ventilation and was deemed unfit for surgery due to critically impaired lung function (Forced expiratory volume in 1 second: 0.36 L, 12.2% predicted). Preoperative high-resolution computed tomography (CT) and 3D reconstruction localized the target bronchus to the right middle lobe. However, percutaneous aspiration and drug injection via drainage tube revealed misalignment, prompting reidentification of the target bronchus in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe. CT-guided percutaneous GEB volume reduction was performed, involving air extraction and intrabullous injection of erythromycin lactobionate. Subsequent selective bronchial occlusion of the posterior right upper lobe segment via bronchoscopic autologous blood and thrombin injection was conducted. Continuous negative-pressure drainage was maintained post-procedure. Follow-up CT at 6 months confirmed complete GEB closure. Dyspnea improved significantly (modified Medical Research Council score 3), exercise capacity increased (6-minute walk distance: 220 m), and ventilator use was discontinued. No complications or recurrence were observed during follow-up. Percutaneous aspiration and drug injection refine target bronchus identification when imaging yields ambiguous results, enhancing precision for subsequent bronchoscopic interventions. This strategy minimizes reliance on endobronchial valves, reducing costs and procedural complexity. Larger studies are needed to validate long-term efficacy, but this approach offers a promising minimally invasive alternative for high-risk patients. Bullae refer to thin-walled air sacs in the lungs that exceed 1 cm in diameter and are commonly associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. As the condition progresses, these bullae can evolve into giant emphysematous bullae (GEB), which typically occupy more than one-third of the volume of a hemithorax. Endobronchial valve (EBV) placement has emerged as a widely accepted alternative treatment option. A 67-year-old male patient with a 2-year history of GEB in the right lung and an 11-year history of COPD presented to our department. The patient had been regularly using inhaled medications and required home noninvasive ventilator support owing to the severity of his condition. Prior to our intervention, the patient’s lung function tests revealed a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV Step 1: CT-guided GEB Catheterization. The radiologist analyzed the preoperative HRCT results and identified the target bronchus associated with the GEB in the lateral segment of the right middle lobe (Fig.  Procedure of GEB volume reduction and confirmation of the GEB target bronchus in the Patient. (A, B) Before treatment, GEB occupied the right middle and right lower lungs, and the radiologist evaluated the target bronchus as the lateral segment of the right middle lobe (white arrow). (C) Under the guidance of CT, a central venous catheter was inserted into the GEB, air was pumped through the drainage tube, and medication was injected. The GEB atrophied to the right upper lobe. (D) Drug deposition in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe (black arrow). (E) Anatomical demarcation reveals: right middle lobe (white arrow), right lower lobe (blue arrow), and posterior segment of right upper lobe (black arrow). Drug deposition and drug-related pneumonia are visible in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, with reduced GEB and drainage tubes seen in the surrounding area. (F) Bronchoscopic visualization of the right upper lobe bronchial orifice demonstrates: apical segment (blue arrow), anterior segment (white arrow), and posterior segment (black arrow). Using a 3-chamber lithotomy balloon, autologous blood was injected into the posterior segment of the right upper lobe. (G) Before discharge, CT was reexamined, indicating that the GEB was nearly closed (black arrow). (H) No recurrence of pulmonary bullae was observed during a follow-up examination 6 months after the procedure. CT = computed tomography, GEB = giant emphysematous bullae. Step 2: Erythromycin Lactobionate Injection and Negative-Pressure Drainage. A dose of 1 g erythromycin lactobionate (dissolved in 50 mL of 50% glucose) was injected into GEB through the central venous catheter. The 3-way connector was closed immediately after injection, and CT imaging was performed 10 minutes later to observe drug deposition patterns and assess for delayed pneumothorax. Post-procedure, the patient underwent continuous ECG monitoring and vital sign surveillance. Follow-up CT revealed contraction of the GEB toward the right upper lobe, with drug deposition localized to the posterior segment of the right upper lobe (Fig.  Step 3: Bronchoscopic Selective Bronchial Occlusion. Five days after the GEB puncture, we inserted a 3-chamber lithotomy balloon via bronchoscopy into the posterior segment of the right upper lobe (Fig.  Six-month follow-up CT confirmed complete GEB closure (Fig.  Comparison of lung function, blood gas analysis, dyspnea, and quality of life scores in GEB patients before surgery, before discharge and 6 months after surgery. %pred = %predicted, 6MWT = 6-minute walking testing, FEV The pathogenesis of GEB is closely associated with the progression of COPD. Core mechanisms include smoking, α1-antitrypsin deficiency, intravenous drug use, cannabis and cocaine consumption, sarcoidosis, and autoimmune disorders. Patients with GEB typically do not respond to medical treatment, making surgical removal the preferred option because of its potential to significantly improve lung function and exercise tolerance. Bronchoscopic and percutaneous GEB volume-reduction techniques have emerged as standard alternative treatments for patients with GEB who are ineligible for surgery. Selecting the correct segmental bronchus for EBV placement in giant emphysematous bullae GEB can be challenging. Conventional imaging techniques, such as high-resolution HRCT and 3D reconstruction, are often used to identify the target bronchus. However, the compression and distortion of adjacent bronchial structures by GEB may obscure anatomical relationships, leading to misidentification of the target bronchus, as demonstrated in our case, where initial HRCT localization discrepancies were corrected via percutaneous aspiration and drug injection, although such cases are relatively rare. Additionally, GEB may alter bronchial orientation or collapse aerated pathways, complicating preoperative planning. Advanced navigation tools (e.g., electromagnetic or virtual bronchoscopy) may improve accuracy, but their efficacy in GEB cases remains understudied. Meta-analytical evidence indicates that the success of EBV therapy is highly dependent on achieving complete isolation of the target lung region. As indicated by relevant studies, Takizawa et al When the patient was in the supine position, the erythromycin lactobionate solution injected into GEB via the drainage tube indeed tended to deposit dorsally due to gravitational effects. To address this, air extraction via the drainage tube was performed to rapidly reduce the GEB volume, causing the bulla to collapse toward its base. Following drug injection through the drainage tube, the majority of the drug deposits in the dorsal region of the GEB, while a small portion may accumulate at the bulla base and subsequently enter the lung parenchyma via the target bronchus (especially after positional changes), potentially causing drug-related pneumonia. In this case, after catheterization and aspiration of the GEB, the bulla shrank toward the right upper lobe, preliminarily localizing the target bronchus to the right upper lobe. Post-injection imaging confirmed drug deposition exclusively in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe. A follow-up CT scan 4 days later revealed that the reduced GEB remained localized to the right upper lung, with drug-related pneumonia observed only in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe (Fig.  The use of bronchoscopic autologous blood injection for GEB volume reduction has been preliminarily explored in previous studies. For instance, case reports Furthermore, in contrast to bronchoscopic EBV placement, percutaneous bulla reduction demonstrates significant cost-effectiveness. Data from recent studies indicate that EBV placement imposes substantial economic strain, as each GEB patient typically requires implantation of 3 valves on average, This case report highlights the efficacy of a combined percutaneous and bronchoscopic approach for volume reduction in surgically ineligible patients with GEB. By integrating CT-guided aspiration, intrabullous sclerotherapy, and selective bronchial occlusion, this minimally invasive strategy achieved complete GEB closure, significant symptomatic improvement, and functional recovery in a high-risk patient with severe COPD. Notably, the use of percutaneous drug injection and aspiration proved instrumental in refining target bronchus identification when conventional imaging yielded ambiguous results, thereby enhancing procedural precision. Despite these promising results, the study is limited by its single-case design and short-term follow-up. Larger prospective studies are warranted to validate long-term efficacy, optimize technical protocols, and identify patient subgroups most likely to benefit.', 'PubMed_Central', 'copd_management', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/', 'research_article', '{"content_hash": "c5e4663510f60442", "embedding_date": "2025-06-25T14:21:38.695066", "scraper_source": "PubMed_Central", "category": "research_literature", "subcategory": "pubmed_central", "document_type": "research_article", "published_date": "", "original_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/"}', 9985);

VALUES ('Penehyclidine combined with antiemetics for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting: A meta-analysis of randomized control trials and trial sequential analysis', 'Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is one of the most common adverse complications associated with anesthesia and after surgical procedures. PONV is related to patient dissatisfaction and can lead to several postoperative complications. This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of penehyclidine combined with antiemetics in preventing PONV. We searched English databases (including PubMed, Web of Science, Ovid Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library), Chinese electronic databases (including China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, VIP, and Chinese Biomedical Literature) and trial registry databases to find randomized controlled trials researching the clinical validity of penehyclidine combined with antiemetics for PONV. The retrieval time was up to January 2025, without publication date restrictions. Articles published in the English and Chinese languages were considered. The primary outcome was the incidence of PONV within and over 24 hours postoperatively. The secondary outcomes were the incidence of different severities of PONV, incidence of postoperative rescue antiemetic therapy and postoperative complications. Quality assessment was conducted with the Cochrane Collaboration’s risk of bias tool and grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation method. Subgroup analyses were performed according to the postoperative observation period. Trial sequential analysis was performed to validate the reliability of the primary outcome. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plots and Egger’s regression test. Sixteen randomized controlled trials comprising 1561 participants were included. Compared with the control group, penehyclidine combined with antiemetics provided a lower incidence of PONV (risk ratio [RR]: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.57–0.74;  Compared with antiemetics, penehyclidine combined with antiemetics could provide better prevention efficiency for PONV, with lower incidence of PONV, lower incidence of severe PONV over 24 hours postoperatively and lower incidence of postoperative rescue antiemetic therapy. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) defined as any nausea, and vomiting within the first 24 to 48 hours after surgery in inpatients, is one of the most common adverse complications associated with anesthesia and surgical procedures, and is strongly related to patient dissatisfaction. Combination therapy involving 2 or more antiemetics that act on different receptors for the prevention of PONV has been recommended by the Consensus Guidelines for the Management of PONV as a risk-based approach to PONV prophylaxis. In recent years, progress has been made in the combination with antiemetic drugs, and anticholinergics have been used to reduce the incidence of PONV. Recent clinical studies have shown that penehyclidine for the prevention of PONV has made good progress in some surgical procedures, such as ophthalmology, laparoscopic bariatric surgery, gynecological laparoscopic surgery, thyroid surgery and stomatology surgery. This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions. The PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Ovid Medline, Embase and Chinese databases (including the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang database, VIP databases and Chinese Biomedical Literature) were searched from inception to January 2025 to identify randomized controlled studies of participants who received penehyclidine combined with antiemetics for PONV. The search keywords were as follows: (penehyclidine) AND ([postoperative nausea and vomiting] OR [PONV]). The search terms were translated into Chinese for study identification in Chinese databases. In addition, the list of references, relevant conference literature, and trial registry databases (WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Clinical Trials.gov, and Chinese Clinical Trials Registry) were scrutinized to identify additional studies. The preliminary search strategy and the details of the search process used for each database are given in Appendix 1, Supplemental Digital Content,  Studies were selected via the PICOS strategy (participants, interventions, comparators, outcomes, and study designs). The inclusion criteria for the studies included in this meta-analysis were as follows: Participants: Patients who underwent surgery under general anesthesia; Types of interventions: Penehyclidine combined with different antiemetic drugs used for PONV (Penehyclidine + Antiemetics group); Types of comparators: Antiemetic drugs other than penehyclidine for PONV (Antiemetics group); Types of outcomes: The primary outcome: The incidence of PONV within and over 24 hours postoperatively. PONV was defined as follows: (1) The development of any nausea, retching, or vomiting after surgery. (2) At least 1 episode of nausea or vomiting or a combination of both symptoms. (3) At least 1 episode of nausea, vomiting, retching, or any combination of these symptoms. The secondary outcomes were as follows: (1) Incidence of different severities of PONV: defined as the ratio of the number of patients who evaluated to the corresponding severity of PONV. The severity of PONV was evaluated as follows: (1) Mild PONV: occurrence of mild nausea or 1 episode of vomiting (2) Moderate PONV: moderate-to-severe nausea, or vomiting for 2 times or more, or any nausea that required only one rescue antiemetic therapy (3) Severe PONV: more than 2 emetic episodes or necessitating more than 1 dose of rescue antiemetics Incidence of postoperative rescue antiemetic therapy: defined as the ratio of the number of patients who had received antiemetics (regardless of how many times the patient had received it) divided by the total number of patients. Incidence of postoperative complications: included dry mouth and other anticholinergic-related complications (including headache; dizziness; fever, defined as a temperature >37.5°C; and urinary retention, defined as required urine recatheterization). Exploratory outcomes (1) Incidence of postoperative nausea (PON): PON is defined as a subjective sensation of an unpleasant feeling associated with an awareness of wanting to vomit. (2) Incidence of postoperative vomiting (POV): POV is defined as the forceful expulsion of gastric contents through the mouth, or dry-retching, and was assessed by the patient’s response of yes or no to questioning. Types of studies: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English or Chinese were included. Studies with the following situations were excluded: studies that only compared the effectiveness of monotherapy with penehyclidine for PONV; studies without randomization for treatment; studies whose data could not be extracted for statistical analysis; and duplicate publications, editorials, letters, abstracts from conferences, reviews, and ongoing trials. Two authors (Hongwei Zhang and Jianqiao Zheng) were required to screen the retrieved studies independently. Briefly, all titles and abstracts identified in the search were carefully examined, duplicate studies and those that did not match the inclusion criteria were excluded. The same 2 authors (Hongwei Zhang and Jianqiao Zheng) read the full text of each remaining study to select any potentially relevant articles. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion and the involvement of a third reviewer (Lu Zhang). A fourth author (Li Du) checked all procedures before approving the data extraction.

The closed dots indicate the observed studies, and the white dots indicate the missing studies imputed by the trim-and-fill method. PONV = postoperative nausea and vomiting. To reduce and adjust for publication bias in this study, trim-and-fill analysis was performed to estimate the number of missing studies that might exist. We assessed the level of evidence of each outcome via the GRADE criteria, and the results are presented in Table  The overall results of GRADE evaluation. Reasons description: 1: The proportion of information from studies at high risk of bias is sufficient to affect the interpretation of results; 2: Total number of events is >300; 3: Asymmetry in funnel plot; 4: Total number of events is <300; 5: Less than 10 studies included; 6: Most information is from studies at low risk of bias; 7: Heterogenetiy > 50%; 8: Heterogenetiy < 50%. CI = 95% confidence interval, GRADE = Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation, PON = postoperative nausea, PONV = postoperative nausea and vomiting, POV = postoperative vomiting, RR = rate ratio. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that penehyclidine combined with antiemetics provided a lower incidence of PONV within and over 24 hours postoperatively, lower incidence of severe PONV over 24 hours postoperatively, and a lower incidence of postoperative rescue antiemetic therapy. However, it was associated with a higher incidence of dry mouth, but did not increase the incidence of other anticholinergic-related complications. Penehyclidine combined with antiemetics resulted in a lower incidence of PONV both within and over 24 hours postoperatively. We speculated that the following reasons may be responsible. First, penehyclidine may reduce the vagal reflex, which may inhibit vagal afferent activation by acting on M1-type receptors to mitigate PONV. Second, penehyclidine can relieve gastrointestinal smooth muscle spasms by acting on M3 cholinergic receptors in the digestive glands and smooth muscle of the digestive tract, which is effective in reducing postoperative gastric intraluminal pressure. Third, penehyclidine postconditioning could improve small intestinal mucosal injury and reduce damage to the barrier function of the small intestinal mucosa caused by limb ischemia-reperfusion. In addition, the elimination half-life of penehyclidine is approximately 24 hours, causing its preventive effect on PONV to diminish or disappear after 24 hours. Dry mouth symptoms were observed in 117 individuals (57.64%) in the Penehyclidine + Antiemetics group, which was significantly higher than that in the Antiemetics group (38 individuals; 18.63%). This could be attributed to its impact on type 3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, leading to reduced glandular secretion from respiratory submucosal glands. As a novel anticholinergic and highly selective antagonist of both type 3 and type 1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, penehyclidine has fewer adverse effects than other anticholinergics. No significant differences were found between the 2 groups regarding other anticholinergic-related side effects, such as headache, dizziness, fever or urinary retention. Delayed recovery of intestinal function and postoperative delirium (POD) are major concerns in the use of anticholinergic drugs. We also investigated the efficacy of penehyclidine combined with routine antiemetics in preventing PON and POV separately. Our meta-analysis revealed that, compared with monotherapy with antiemetics alone, penehyclidine combined with antiemetics provided a lower incidence of PON and POV. However, few trials have contributed data to the subgroup analysis of the incidence of PON and POV, indicating that subgroup analysis may not be able to detect the advantages of penehyclidine combined with antiemetics because of the insufficient sample size. Moreover, penehyclidine could play a role in preventing PONV by blocking both the type 1 and type 3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which play important roles in the pathogenesis of PONV. The risk factors for PONV included female sex, inhaled anesthesia for >60 minutes, high-risk procedures (cholecystectomy, laparoscopic, gynecologic), and age < 50 years. For the primary outcome, TSA was performed to test the validity, and publication bias was assessed to assess the stability. In addition, GRADE was performed to test the quality evidence of all the outcomes. The TSA of the pooled meta-analysis revealed strong evidence that penehyclidine combined with antiemetics provided a lower incidence of PONV within 24 hours postoperatively, and that evidence for the incidence of PONV over 24 hours postoperatively was uncertain. Significant publication bias was indicated, and trim-and-fill analysis was performed to reduce and adjust for publication bias. Fortunately, the correction for potential publication bias did not materially alter the stability of the results. The results of the GRADE analysis indicated that the evidence quality of the outcomes was low to very low, indicating that the clinical value of penehyclidine combined with antiemetics in preventing PONV is limited. Therefore, more RCTs are required in the future to improve the evidence quality of the results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis pooling and analyzing the efficacy and safety of penehyclidine combined with antiemetics for PONV. For the primary outcome, TSA was performed to test the validity, and publication bias was assessed by visual judgment of the funnel plot asymmetry, Egger’s regression test, and trim-and-fill analysis to check the stability of the primary outcome. In addition, GRADE was performed to test the evidence quality of all the outcomes. There are also limitations to our analysis. First, the number of studies with eligible data was limited, and the sample size of each included study was small. Potential heterogeneity could exist, which could result in inadequate statistical power for the outcomes. Therefore, TSA was performed as an additional statistical analysis for the primary outcome. Second, potential clinical and methodological heterogeneity related to the patient population, type of surgery, anesthesia maintenance method, different antiemetics, and different administration times, which could influence the outcomes. Third, the pooled results were supported by a low or very low quality of evidence according to GRADE. Therefore, the clinical value of the results is limited. Therefore, future RCTs with larger sample sizes, clinical consistency, and methodological consistency are required to confirm our findings. Based on current published evidence, compared with antiemetics, penehyclidine combined with antiemetics provides better prevention efficiency for PONV by decreasing the incidence of PONV (a lower incidence of PON and a lower incidence of POV) and severe PONV over 24 hours postoperatively. Penehyclidine combined with antiemetics is associated with a higher incidence of dry mouth, whereas the incidence of other anticholinergic-related complications is not different. These findings may provide a new prevention therapy for PONV. Further RCTs with larger sample sizes, consistent clinical assessments, and methodological consistency are required to improve our understanding of the subject.', 'PubMed_Central', 'copd_management', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/', 'research_article', '{"content_hash": "3be8aabb0f04504b", "embedding_date": "2025-06-25T14:21:39.923702", "scraper_source": "PubMed_Central", "category": "research_literature", "subcategory": "pubmed_central", "document_type": "research_article", "published_date": "", "original_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/"}', 21606);

VALUES ('Functional ambulation recovery in MCA stroke survivors: Predictive role of cognitive function and extremely low alanine aminotransferase levels: A retrospective observational study', 'Stroke is a leading cause of disability, significantly impacting mobility. Effective rehabilitation depends on accurate predictors of recovery. Recent studies suggest that both cognitive function and certain initial laboratory biomarkers, such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), could be crucial for predicting recovery outcomes. This study investigates how cognitive function and ALT levels can predict functional ambulation in survivors of middle cerebral artery stroke. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 87 patients who began rehabilitation within 30 days of their first middle cerebral artery stroke. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to identify predictors of ambulation recovery. The variables assessed included age, sex, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Berg Balance Scale, Mini-Mental State Examination, and extremely low ALT levels. Multivariate binary logistic regression revealed that female sex, lower Mini-Mental State Examination and Berg Balance Scale scores, and extremely low ALT levels were associated with poorer odds of achieving functional ambulation. This research underscores the critical role of integrating cognitive assessments and routine biomarkers into rehabilitation practices to enhance prognostic accuracy and personalize rehabilitation strategies. The findings highlight the need for further investigation to confirm these results and explore the underlying mechanisms, with the aim of advancing individualized rehabilitation approaches and improving patient outcomes. Stroke has a high prevalence worldwide and is a major health issue, with millions of people suffering from disabilities each year. Previous studies have highlighted several factors associated with functional mobility in stroke patients, including stroke type, age, sex, initial stroke severity as measured by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), cognitive function, and motor function of the lower extremities. Cognitive function has a significant impact on the rehabilitation and functional recovery of stroke patients. Another factor that may have a significant impact on functional recovery after stroke is frailty. If frailty can be detected early through routine testing, it would be beneficial to have a precise, individualized rehabilitation plan. There is a substantial body of research that suggests that extremely low ALT levels found on routine testing are associated with frailty and sarcopenia, and even mortality in the elderly following physical stress. Middle cerebral artery (MCA) strokes, which affect specific brain regions, frequently result in substantial impairment of hand function due to the localization of the lesion. Despite this potential for ambulation recovery, a significant number of patients still fail to achieve functional ambulation within the short-term rehabilitation period. This can be attributed to various factors, including the severity of the initial stroke, the presence of cognitive impairments, and other underlying health conditions. The necessity for extended rehabilitation highlights the importance of identifying precise predictors of ambulation recovery to tailor rehabilitation programs more effectively and enhance patient outcomes. The objective of this study is to enhance the precision of prognostic assessments for functional ambulation recovery in MCA stroke survivors by evaluating the predictive value of cognitive function and extremely low levels of ALT. By integrating these indicators, the research aims to provide actionable insights that can guide personalized rehabilitation strategies and improve recovery outcomes, addressing a critical gap in current stroke rehabilitation practices. This retrospective medical record review study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of a university-affiliated hospital. Given its retrospective nature, the need for written informed consent was waived. This research was conducted using a retrospective analysis of electronically documented medical records, employing data derived from routine clinical evaluations and assessments performed during standard care protocols. The Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC) tool was utilized as the primary criterion for assessing ambulation, ensuring consistent evaluation across different studies and enhancing the comparability and reliability of results. Balance, encompassing both fundamental lower limb motor functions and proprioceptive aspects, was identified as a critical body function for functional ambulation. Thus, the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) was chosen as a key predictor due to its comprehensive assessment of balance, which is essential for evaluating functional ambulation outcomes. Cognitive function, which has been widely studied for its influence on post-stroke recovery of walking ability, was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Regarding the inclusion of laboratory findings, routine blood tests conducted during the acute phase of stroke were retrospectively collected and analyzed for their prognostic significance. This approach focused on blood test results from the time of stroke onset to identify biomarkers that could influence clinical outcomes and prognosis. Creatinine was included due to its well-documented association with functional outcomes post-stroke, serving as a covariate to adjust for its prognostic influence. This retrospective chart review study was performed in line with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Approval was granted by the Institutional Review Board of the Catholic Kwandong University International St Mary’s Hospital (Institutional Review Board No. IS24RISI0006, 2024). Given its retrospective nature and use of de-identified medical records, the requirement for written informed consent was waived. A retrospective medical record review study conducted at a university-affiliated hospital from June 2016 to June 2023. Patients who were diagnosed with a first stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), transferred to a rehabilitation department, and started rehabilitation within 30 days of their first stroke were defined as initial subacute stroke patients and were included in the study. This study focused only on subjects with hemiplegic MCA stroke who were not initially able to ambulate. Patients were excluded from the study if they (1) had musculoskeletal disorders that could influence their gait; (2) presented with quadriplegia due to bilateral brain involvement; (3) had a concurrent stroke in regions other than the MCA; (4) had liver disease or an ALT level exceeding 40 U/L; or (5) could ambulate functionally from the initial assessment, including those with a FAC scale of 3 or higher. A total of 87 subjects were included in the retrospective analysis. The primary outcome was whether functional ambulation was achieved after short-term (1–2 months) subacute rehabilitation assessed using FAC. The FAC scale evaluates ambulation ability, with scales defined as follows: FAC 0 indicates non-ambulatory status; FAC 1 requires assistance for a few steps; FAC 2 allows independent walking for short distances but needs help for longer distances or uneven surfaces; FAC 3 signifies independent ambulation on flat surfaces, with possible assistance needed for stairs; FAC 4 denotes independent walking in all situations, including stairs and uneven terrain; and FAC 5 represents full independence in any environment. Among the covariates, basic clinical data included age, sex, and comorbidities. The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was used as a covariate to adjust for the impact of comorbidities on post-stroke ambulation function recovery. Among the covariates, clinical indicators related to stroke were investigated as type of stroke (hemorrhagic or ischemic) and location of brain lesion (left or right), initial NIHSS as the initial severity of the stroke. The BBS is a clinical assessment tool with a maximum score of 56, with higher scores indicating better balance ability. Routine laboratory biomarkers included as covariates were creatinine for renal function, albumin and hemoglobin for nutritional status, ALT for its potential link to frailty. We specifically focused on initial cognitive function, balance ability, and extremely low ALT levels as key covariates in predicting functional ambulation acquisition. To assess these predictors, we converted them into binary variables for a binary logistic regression model. The MMSE was categorized into low (below 20) and high (20 and above) groups based on prior research indicating differing outcomes. We conducted statistical analyses using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Subjects were divided into a group that achieved functional ambulation after subacute rehabilitation following MCA stroke and a group that remained unable to walk at the time of discharge (approximately 1–2 months post-rehabilitation). Normality was assessed using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Differences between groups were compared using independent  To identify predictors of functional ambulation acquisition, binary logistic regression was employed, conducting both univariate and multivariate analyses. The multivariate analysis utilized the backward stepwise (conditional) method to include multiple covariates and identify statistically significant predictors, adjusting for potential confounders The significance level was set at  The average age of individuals who did not achieve functional ambulation was significantly higher at 69.4 ± 13.2 years compared to 61.2 ± 11.5 years for those who did ( General characteristics and functional ambulation after subacute rehabilitation.

In summary, this study investigated factors affecting functional ambulation after subacute rehabilitation in stroke patients. The key findings indicate that sex, age, initial MMSE, serum hemoglobin, albumin, extremely low-level serum ALT, CCI, and initial BBS were significantly associated with functional ambulation outcomes. Multivariate analysis revealed that being male, younger, having higher serum hemoglobin, higher MMSE, and higher initial BBS scores predicted better ambulation outcomes. Additionally, patients with extremely low-level serum ALT were less likely to achieve functional ambulation compared to those with ALT levels within the normal reference range. This study aimed to elucidate the determinants of functional ambulation in stroke patients undergoing subacute rehabilitation, addressing a critical gap in understanding recovery trajectories. Stroke remains a leading cause of long-term disability, with functional mobility being a key determinant of patient independence and quality of life. Identifying predictive factors for successful rehabilitation outcomes is thus essential. The research was guided by the hypothesis that a multifactorial approach, incorporating clinical, cognitive, and biochemical parameters, such as initial NIHSS scores, serum hemoglobin, extremely low-level ALT, MMSE scores, and BBS scores, would yield robust predictors of functional ambulation. The findings substantiated this hypothesis, revealing significant associations between better ambulation and variables such as younger age, male sex, higher serum hemoglobin, and superior cognitive and balance function, while extremely low serum ALT levels were linked to poorer outcomes. The integration of routinely measured laboratory biomarkers into this analysis enhances its clinical relevance, as these markers are readily available at the time of stroke diagnosis. For instance, ALT and albumin levels, although traditionally associated with liver function and nutritional status respectively, may also reflect broader systemic conditions like frailty, sarcopenia, and overall physical resilience, which are critical in the context of stroke recovery. The relevance of ALT, particularly its association with frailty, disability, and adverse outcomes, extends beyond traditional hepatic concerns. Low ALT levels have emerged in recent literature as markers of frailty and poor survival in elderly populations. Routine laboratory biomarkers were included in this analysis due to their potential clinical utility in prognosis. Some biomarkers that are routinely measured during initial blood tests, if found to be linked to outcomes, could greatly enhance clinical decision-making. The results in Table  Regarding ALT, although no significant differences were observed when treated as a continuous variable, categorizing ALT levels revealed notable differences, underscoring the relevance of extremely low ALT levels in frailty and recovery prediction. Hemoglobin and albumin levels, indicators of nutritional status, were also significant, consistent with other studies that link good nutritional status to better functional recovery. The multivariate logistic regression analysis in Table  Considering these findings, the clinical implications of this study are significant. The inclusion of routinely measured biomarkers like ALT and albumin in the initial evaluation of stroke patients could enhance prognostic accuracy and guide tailored intervention strategies. Specifically, early identification of patients with extremely low ALT levels or low albumin could prompt more intensive frailty management and personalized rehabilitation plans. By recognizing these indicators as predictors rather than treatment targets, clinicians can better anticipate challenges in recovery and optimize resource allocation. Moreover, this study highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to stroke rehabilitation. The integration of cognitive rehabilitation, frailty management, and physical therapy is vital in addressing the diverse needs of stroke patients. Frailty management emerges as a key area of focus, given its close association with poor recovery outcomes. The findings also open avenues for future research. Larger, multicenter studies are needed to validate these results and explore additional biomarkers that could refine prognostic models. Moreover, prospective studies should investigate the longitudinal impact of these predictors on long-term outcomes, helping to identify optimal intervention windows and strategies. Further exploration of the mechanisms linking low ALT levels to frailty and recovery could also yield novel therapeutic targets, offering new directions for enhancing rehabilitation outcomes. This study has several limitations, including a relatively small sample size and the retrospective nature of the analysis, which may introduce selection bias. Another important limitation is the potential ambiguity in interpreting low ALT levels. While extremely low ALT is associated with frailty, it may also reflect other unmeasured confounders such as undiagnosed liver disease or variations in muscle mass. These factors could contribute to outcome differences and warrant careful consideration in interpreting our findings. Additionally, the study population was limited to patients from a single institution, which may affect the generalizability of the findings. Future studies should include prospective validation in larger, multicenter cohorts to confirm these associations and explore the potential dose–response relationship between continuous ALT levels and rehabilitation outcomes. Furthermore, targeted frailty interventions in patients with low ALT levels should be investigated to assess whether such approaches can enhance functional ambulation recovery. In conclusion, this study offers a comprehensive analysis of factors influencing functional ambulation in stroke patients undergoing subacute rehabilitation. By integrating clinical evaluations, cognitive assessments, and initial biochemical markers, particularly focusing on extremely low levels of ALT, the research provides a robust framework for understanding recovery mechanisms. The findings emphasize the critical role of cognitive and physical evaluations alongside baseline serum biomarkers, with extremely low ALT levels emerging as a significant predictor of rehabilitation outcomes. This study advances theoretical knowledge and supports the implementation of personalized rehabilitation strategies aligned with precision medicine principles. Future research should focus on further refining these prognostic indicators, especially the role of extremely low ALT levels, and explore additional variables to enhance predictive accuracy, thereby advancing both theoretical insights and clinical applications in stroke rehabilitation.', 'PubMed_Central', 'copd_management', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/', 'research_article', '{"content_hash": "8657ef4b4f498915", "embedding_date": "2025-06-25T14:21:42.412723", "scraper_source": "PubMed_Central", "category": "research_literature", "subcategory": "pubmed_central", "document_type": "research_article", "published_date": "", "original_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/"}', 17719);

VALUES ('WHO Health Topic: Diabetes', 'Overview Diabetes is a chronic, metabolic disease characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose (or blood sugar), which leads over time to serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves. The most common is type 2 diabetes, usually in adults, which occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn''t make enough insulin. In the past 3 decades the prevalence of type 2 diabetes has risen dramatically in countries of all income levels. Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin by itself. For people living with diabetes, access to affordable treatment, including insulin, is critical to their survival. There is a globally agreed target to halt the rise in diabetes and obesity by 2025.About 830 million people worldwide have diabetes, the majority living in low-and middle-income countries. More than half of people living with diabetes are not receiving treatment. Both the number of people with diabetes and the number of people with untreated diabetes have been steadily increasing over the past decades. Symptoms test Symptoms of type 1 diabetes include the need to urinate often, thirst, constant hunger, weight loss, vision changes and fatigue. These symptoms may occur suddenly. Symptoms for type 2 diabetes are generally similar to those of type 1 diabetes but are often less marked. As a result, the disease may be diagnosed several years after onset, after complications have already arisen. For this reason, it is important to be aware of risk factors. Prevention and treatment test Type 1 diabetes cannot currently be prevented. Effective approaches are available to prevent type 2 diabetes and to prevent the complications and premature death that can result from all types of diabetes. These include policies and practices across whole populations and within specific settings (school, home, workplace) that contribute to good health for everyone, regardless of whether they have diabetes, such as exercising regularly, eating healthily, avoiding smoking, and controlling blood pressure and lipids. The starting point for living well with diabetes is an early diagnosis – the longer a person lives with undiagnosed and untreated diabetes, the worse their health outcomes are likely to be. Easy access to basic diagnostics, such as blood glucose testing, should therefore be available in primary health care settings. Patients will need periodic specialist assessment or treatment for complications. A series of cost-effective interventions can improve patient outcomes, regardless of what type of diabetes they may have. These interventions include blood glucose control through a combination of diet, physical activity and, if necessary, medication; control of blood pressure and lipids to reduce cardiovascular risk and other complications; and regular screening for damage to the eyes, kidneys and feet to facilitate early treatment.
